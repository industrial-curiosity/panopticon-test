# Testing

Panopticon's Python tooling is stdlib-only (see
`.agents/skills/panopticon-python-tooling`), and so is its
test suite: plain `unittest`, no third-party test runner, no build step.

## Running the suite

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -t . -s tests
```

- **Prerequisites:** a repo checkout and a system `python3` (3.9+). Nothing to
  install.
- **Pass criteria:** exit code 0 with `OK` in the summary line. Any `FAILED` or
  `ERROR` output is a failure.
- **Ordering:** tests are independent; discovery order does not matter.

Run a single module while iterating:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests.test_merge -v
```

## Reusable-workflow contracts

GitHub Actions validates a reusable-workflow call before it creates any jobs.
An undeclared `inputs.<name>` or `secrets.<name>` reference therefore appears as
an **Invalid workflow file** or zero-job startup failure, rather than as a
failing evaluation job.

Validate every shipped reusable workflow contract locally before release:

Provider configuration coverage also verifies that optional request budgets stay
optional in bootstrap and finalization reports, that generated callers carry a
pre-job timeout fallback, and that the fixed instance Action resolves before
provider preflight without receiving credentials.

```bash
python3 -m panopticon.workflow_contracts --workflows-dir .github/workflows
```

The command exits non-zero and identifies every undeclared reference. Either
declare the caller value in the workflow's `on.workflow_call.inputs` or
`on.workflow_call.secrets` map, or remove the reference if it belongs to a
different provider. The credential-free template-validation workflow runs this
same discovery command and the full Python suite for pull requests, pushes, and
manual dispatches. Then rerun the command and the full test suite.

## Four-gate rollout verification

Local checks prove the deterministic parts of the rollout process. They do not
replace a sandbox run against a real private instance and provider:

| Gate | Local evidence | Operational proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reusable-workflow access | `tests/test_provider_workflows.py` checks the selected workflow contract; use the setup guide's access-policy API and Contents API commands with placeholders for a real instance | The run page allows the child to create a job and the selected workflow is readable at the configured ref |
| Effective provider configuration | `tests/test_config.py`, `tests/test_configure_instance.py`, `tests/test_init_repo.py`, and `tests/test_recovery.py` cover required/optional values, defaults, caller-compatibility revisions, legacy revision acceptance, and exact recovery | The instance configuration run is green, the caller-compatibility revision matches (or an accepted legacy revision is present), and effective values resolve before preflight without printing values |
| Caller identity and credentials | `tests/test_provider_workflows.py` checks `id-token: write`, the bounded instance-managed step, the caller-owned `always()` recovery, and `aws sts get-caller-identity` wiring; no local test fabricates cloud identity | The child credential step and identity check succeed for the exact caller repository; a deliberately unregistered sandbox child fails with gate-specific recovery |
| Real provider-request compatibility | `tests/test_llm.py` covers provider request shape, Bedrock omission of unsupported optional fields, and structured-response correction; preflight tests are not inference tests | One real structured inference completes with the rollout model after credential and capability preflight |

For a private or internal instance, run the deterministic access check before
child bootstrap. The access endpoint is authoritative for policy; a zero-job
`workflow was not found` banner must not be diagnosed as missing YAML until the
policy and selected workflow Contents lookups have passed. Keep organization
registration commands, account IDs, role names, and model identifiers in a
private sandbox record, not in this public test documentation.

## Important recovery coverage

- `tests/test_sync.py` verifies that a pinned workflow ref uses its own caller
  renderer and that renderer syntax, execution, and callback failures return a
  safe error without a raw traceback.
- `tests/test_install.py` verifies unavailable fetched callers use the bundled
  workflow tuple and renderer, while fetched encoding, syntax, execution, and
  callback failures return a safe error without a raw traceback or partial
  managed writes.
- `tests/test_provider_workflows.py` verifies the configuration action derives
  optional provider values from the validated contract without persisting
  contract-only metadata in `panopticon.config.json`.

- `tests/test_install.py`, `tests/test_sync.py`, and
  `tests/test_install_self_bootstrap.py` cover rate-limit classification,
  GitHub-directed `Retry-After` and reset-header delays, retry exhaustion,
  immediate forbidden failures, and safe progress output.
- `tests/test_org_diagram_link.py` covers first-time initialization deriving an
  org-diagram link from the bootstrap caller workflow, plus its explicit
  recovery guidance when that workflow is absent.

## Suite layout

| Module | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/test_config.py` | Org defaults and validation, including an intentionally unconfigured template, trusted LiteLLM, OpenAI, and Bedrock contracts (direct GitHub OIDC and instance-managed credential modes), OpenAI's fixed endpoint with no configurable endpoint variable, deterministic revisions, optional non-secret defaults and source precedence, configurable Actions names, gating, protected paths, internal registries, child config, and diagram config |
| `tests/test_interface_lookup.py` | Validated instance compiled-interface-index loading from a checkout or GitHub Contents fallback, including fresh missing indexes, malformed indexes, and loud retrieval failures |
| `tests/test_configure_instance.py` | Instance provider configuration persistence, direct-OIDC and instance-managed Bedrock configuration, closed-registry CLI rejection, Bedrock-only `--model-default` validation and acceptance, unchanged contract revisions across workflow entrypoint changes, name validation before writes, and preservation of unrelated config |
| `tests/test_currency.py` | Index-currency verdict parsing, loud failures on malformed verdicts, report formatting, `collect_actions` (a stale index yields the single `run_doc_generation` action plus `commit_and_push` — matching drift.py's `run_doc_generation` kind so a shared fix collapses to one TL;DR line across both checks), `main()`'s exit-code contract (`TestMainExitCodes`: current → `0`, stale → `2`, an operational failure raised as `LLMResponseError` → neither `0` nor `2` — `1` is never a verdict, since that's the code an uncaught exception would produce by default; the same test also asserts the operational failure writes a `format_operational_failure`-style "could not run" section to `--report-file` instead of leaving it unwritten); a first response that's prose instead of JSON recovers via `LLMClient.complete_json`'s corrective retry and still produces the correct verdict |
| `tests/test_dependencies.py` | Dependency index schema (`panopticon/dependencies.py`) — a separate schema/file family from the interface index (`panopticon/index.py`/`tests/test_index.py`), covering internal (same-org) library/package dependencies rather than runtime interfaces: valid local/consumer round-trips, `apis` allowed only on consumer repo objects (rejected on producer objects, must be a list of non-empty strings), `links_to_interface` requiring both `name` and `type` when present, conflict-reason validation (`ownership-dispute` requires non-empty `claims`, the dependency-specific `unregistered-producer` reason allows empty `claims`), duplicate-ecosystem-under-key rejection, `extracted_by` restricted to `llm`, deterministic `dumps_index` ordering including deduplicated/sorted `apis` lists, and save/load round-trips |
| `tests/test_dependency_extraction.py` | Dependency extraction driver (`panopticon/dependency_extraction.py`, mirroring `test_extraction.py`'s interface-side coverage for a distinct candidate/schema family): `detecting_dependency_parsers`/`run_dependency_parsers` registry behavior; a full `extract_repo` pass over `sample_go_repo/` producing self-registration, consumer entries, and unioned `source_files`/`apis` across multiple candidates for the same dependency; `dependency_candidates_to_index`'s unresolvable-name failure names `panopticon-dependency` (never the interface hint); `panopticon-dependency-of` hint resolution into `links_to_interface` from the repo's own local interface index, left unset when the named interface isn't found locally or no `repo_root` is given; `resolve_candidate_internality` (detection layers 2–3, independently tested since no shipped parser yet produces "ambiguous" candidates that need them) via registry-host match and instance cross-reference; `fallback_candidate_files` coverage/changed-file filtering; the full `llm_extract` contract (tagging, gap reporting, skill loading, malformed/prose/code-fenced responses, retry recovery) reusing the shared `FakeClient` from `test_extraction.py` |
| `tests/test_dependency_lookup.py` | Registry-host detection (`is_internal_registry`: bare host match, scheme/path-bearing URL match, no match, empty registries/URL never match) and the instance cross-reference (`lookup_registered_producer`): a checkout hit resolves with no network call; a checkout present but the name absent returns `None` without falling back to the network (the checkout is authoritative when present); no checkout falls back to a live GitHub Contents API read (stubbed `urlopen`, mirroring `test_org_diagram_link.py`'s pattern); a live-API failure returns `None` rather than a guess; neither a checkout nor an `instance` given returns `None` with no network attempt at all |
| `tests/test_dependency_merge.py` | Dependency merge core (`panopticon/dependency_merge.py`, mirroring `test_merge.py`'s coverage for the dependency schema): shard replace, compiled-index rebuild reproducibility and round-trip fidelity, `ownership-dispute` (two repos self-registering the same name), the dependency-specific `unregistered-producer` (a consumer with no producer shard anywhere, clearing once one registers), confirmation that a non-self owner claim is silently ignored rather than treated as an attribution-mismatch conflict (dependencies have no such category — see the module docstring), simulation/merge parity, the `python3 -m panopticon.dependency_merge` CLI (same exit-code contract as `panopticon.merge`), and (as of the architecture-diagrams delta) that `merge_into_instance` writes the org diagram with dependency edges rendered (solid) and, since `write_org_diagram` reads both compiled indices fresh from disk, still renders the instance's existing interface relationships even from a dependency-only merge |
| `tests/test_dependency_parsers.py` | Dependency parsers (separate from `test_parsers.py`'s interface parsers — a distinct registry/candidate shape) — starting with `panopticon/parsers/go_mod.py`: `detect()` on a repo with/without `go.mod`; self-registration as producer from the module path alone (no corroborating evidence needed for Go); an internal `require` entry becomes a consumer candidate from `go.mod` with no `apis`; an external (non-org) `require` entry produces no candidate; the source-scan phase records the specific imported subpackage paths as `apis` from a `.go` file's import block; a `panopticon-dependency-of` hint on a `require` line resolves via `links_to_interface_hint`; a repo with no `panopticon/config.json` (no known org identity) yields no candidates rather than guessing |
| `tests/test_diagram_check.py` | The deterministic diagram-existence PR check (`panopticon/diagram_check.py`, no LLM): report formatting for the pass/missing cases, `collect_actions` (missing/malformed collapses into the same `run_doc_generation` + `commit_and_push` pair drift.py/currency.py use), `main()`'s exit-code contract (well-formed → `0`, missing/malformed → `2`, an unsupported configured format → neither `0` nor `2`, with a "could not run" `--report-file` section), and that the instance's configured format is honored |
| `tests/test_diagrams.py` | Deterministic org-wide diagram rendering (`panopticon/diagrams.py`) from the compiled indices: every participating repository interface is listed, including local-only interfaces; dependencies remain external-only; interface resources have directional Mermaid nodes and tables; detected conflicts have a conditional summary and red/bold node/table emphasis; deterministic ordering, configured-format fenced-block tagging, navigation links, empty-state rendering, and combined interface/dependency rendering including explicit linked dependencies are also covered |
| `tests/test_docs.py` | Deterministic interface-doc rendering, in-place regeneration and component pruning, four-layer validation including the `## Architecture diagram` section (`TestDiagramSection`: well-formed section valid, default/configured format honored, missing heading, missing fenced block, fence not directly under the heading, wrong-language fenced block, and that `validate_docs()` folds the diagram check into the architecture-overview layer without double-reporting when the file itself is missing) |
| `tests/test_drift.py` | Doc-drift verdict parsing, loud failures on malformed verdicts, PR-comment/step-summary report formatting including per-doc-type remediation (`interfaces.md`'s specific `python3 -m panopticon.docs render` command vs. the panopticon-doc-generation skill for the other three layers) and the same-branch-push/auto-rerun statement, `collect_actions` (any number of stale docs, including `interfaces.md`, collapse into one `run_doc_generation` TL;DR action plus `commit_and_push` — never one action per doc), `main()`'s exit-code contract (`TestMainExitCodes`: clean → `0`, stale → `2`, an operational failure raised as `LLMResponseError` → neither `0` nor `2` — `1` is never a verdict, since that's the code an uncaught exception would produce by default; also asserts the failure writes a "could not run" section to `--report-file`, never a "stale" one); a first response that's prose reasoning instead of JSON (the exact failure mode a real CI run hit) recovers via corrective retry instead of crashing the check |
| `tests/test_extraction.py` | Parser-candidate folding into a local index, LLM fallback tagging (`extracted_by: llm`), parser-gap recommendations, CI changed-file scoping; a prose first response recovers via corrective retry; a response item missing a required field (`raw_name`/`type`/`source_file`) is now validated and corrected via the same retry path rather than crashing with an uncaught `KeyError` (a pre-existing gap closed by this coverage), and still fails loudly if every attempt is malformed; the shared `FakeClient` (used by this file, `test_drift.py`, and `test_currency.py`) delegates `complete_with_skill`/`complete_json` to the real `LLMClient` implementations bound to the fake, so these tests exercise the actual retry/parse/validate logic rather than a reimplementation of it |
| `tests/test_index.py` | Index schema validation, deterministic save/load round-trips, and valid potential-name-collision conflict entries |
| `tests/test_init_repo.py` | Init validation gate (config written only when docs/index pass), durable initialization reporting (`panopticon-initialization-report.md` is written for blocked, clean, organization-verification, and repeat finalization outcomes), caller-workflow wiring, docs-location adoption, idempotent re-init, report-only secret verification (gh CLI stubbed; no network) — including manual verification steps printed when `gh` is missing or unauthenticated; `discover_workflow_ref` parsing the ref from the wired caller workflow's `uses:@ref` line (plain branch, pinned tag, missing file, unparseable file); `_fallback_workflow_ref` falling back to the child repo's real checked-out git branch (via a real `git init` in a temp dir) or the literal `"main"` when the repo isn't a git repo at all; `initialize()`'s default `workflow_ref=None` deriving from the wired workflow file end-to-end instead of ever writing a hardcoded value; `_resolve_instance_default_branch` (stubbed `urlopen` against the `GET /repos/{instance}` metadata call, `env` controlling `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`): resolves via either token env var, reflects the instance's actual default branch including a non-`main` name, still resolves via `GH_TOKEN` even when `gh` is installed but `gh auth login` was never run (the regression this rework fixed — `gh api` as a subprocess depends on that separate precondition; this module now uses the same token/transport mechanism `bootstrap.py` already uses successfully), still attempts an unauthenticated call when no token is available at all, and returns `None` (never a guess) when the API call itself fails; `initialize()` persists the resolved `instance_default_branch` into `panopticon/config.json` when resolvable, omits it (with an explanatory message) when not, and never conflates it with a `workflow_ref` pinned to a different tag/branch |
| `tests/test_install.py` | Bootstrap installer (`install.py`): skill download filtering, caller-workflow wiring, fetched caller-renderer encoding/syntax/execution/missing-symbol failures, non-callable compatibility exports, render callback failures, and all renderer failures' controlled no-traceback/no-write boundary; `PANOPTICON_INSTANCE` env/prompt resolution, token resolution (`GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`/`gh auth token`), org CI prerequisite reporting including the token-less manual-verification-steps path, `main()`'s `workflow_ref` default (falls back to the instance repo's default branch, not a tag, when org config omits it), and a private-instance, custom-workflow-ref failure when the fixed instance-managed credential action is absent (no child writes; exact bootstrap recovery command); skills location selection (`PANOPTICON_SKILLS_LOCATION` env override, idempotent re-run detection via `_detect_existing_location`, typed-answer parsing, downloading skills only to the chosen location — `.agents/skills/` is never created if another location is picked), the arrow-key menu (`_apply_key` pure state-transition tests plus a real pseudo-terminal-pair integration test driving `_arrow_key_menu`, not mocked), vendoring the local-tooling subset of `panopticon/` into the child repo (`download_local_tooling` writes exactly `LOCAL_TOOLING_MODULES`, including `providers.py` for `config.py` imports, never requests a CI-only module, idempotent overwrite, vendored end-to-end via a full `main()` run), the vendored subset's `.gitignore` (`write_local_tooling_gitignore` writes `panopticon/.gitignore` containing exactly `__pycache__/`, creates `panopticon/` if absent, idempotent rerun doesn't duplicate content; end-to-end `main()` test confirms it's present alongside the vendored modules), agent prompt text (single `/panopticon-init` invocation, no hardcoded skill location, no per-instance interpolation, all network calls stubbed), per-file `[n/total]` progress lines printed by `download_skills`/`download_local_tooling`/`wire_workflows` (captured via `contextlib.redirect_stdout`), `_api_get`'s retry-with-backoff (transient `5xx`/`429`/connection errors retried up to 3 attempts with a fake injected `sleep`, non-transient `401`/`403`/`404` fail on the first attempt with no retry, retries-exhausted still raises the same status-code-and-body error format); the getting-started guide (`download_getting_started_guide` downloads `PANOPTICON.md` to the child repo's root and overwrites it in place on re-run; `sync_reminder()` names `PANOPTICON.md` and both `python3 -m panopticon.sync` forms; end-to-end `main()` tests confirm both are present on first bootstrap and re-run alike); `instance_default_branch` refresh (`fetch_instance_default_branch` reusing the module's existing `_api_get`; `refresh_instance_default_branch` is a no-op when `panopticon/config.json` doesn't exist yet, updates only that one field in place — leaving `repo`/`workflow_ref`/`docs_location` untouched — when it does, and leaves the file untouched entirely when resolution fails; end-to-end `main()` tests confirm a rerun on an already-initialized repo updates the field and that a first bootstrap never creates `panopticon/config.json` at all) |
| `tests/test_install_self_bootstrap.py` | Public `install.py` launcher and default instance payload: `PANOPTICON_INSTANCE` validation and non-interactive failure; real pseudo-terminal visible and hidden prompts while stdin is unavailable, including secret non-echo; token precedence (`GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `gh auth token`), anonymous public access, hidden-token private retry, and redacted authenticated errors; explicit `PANOPTICON_INSTANCE_REF`, live default-branch resolution, ref URL encoding, authorization headers, GitHub line-wrapped base64, and invalid API payloads; customized payload execution with the child working directory, pass-through environment, and recursion marker; template-derived instance execution loading the existing default bootstrap exactly once. Uses stubbed GitHub API responses and isolated subprocesses where process-level behavior matters — no network. Pass criterion: all assertions pass; no ordering dependency on other test modules. |
| `tests/test_merge.py` | Shard replacement, deterministic compiled-index rebuilds, ordinary conflicts, disjoint same-name/different-type potential-name collisions, overlapping migrations, collision round-trips/removal, simulation/merge parity, CLI exit/report behavior, action generation, and org-diagram rebuild behavior |
| `tests/test_llm.py` | CI agent runtime: request shape, retries, request-budget defaults and validation, workflow variable wiring, OpenAI's fixed base URL even when an endpoint environment variable is present, Bedrock's native Converse request shape omitting unconfirmed inference parameters even when the shared client receives a temperature argument, fail-loudly degradation paths, skill loading (uses an in-process stub `/chat/completions` server; no network); `LLMClient.complete_json`'s corrective-retry loop (`TestCompleteJson`) — first-attempt success triggers no retry; a malformed/non-JSON first response followed by a compliant second response succeeds, returning the *second* response; an invalid request-budget variable fails before a request is sent; a `validate()` `ValueError` (syntactically valid JSON, wrong shape) is corrected via the same retry path as a JSON parse failure; the corrective message sent on retry names the specific validation error and restates "ONLY the JSON `{expected_shape}`"; the conversation sent on retry grows with the failed attempt as an `assistant` turn plus the correction as a `user` turn (never a fresh, memoryless request); exhausting `max_correction_attempts` raises `LLMResponseError` naming `response_label` after exactly `max_correction_attempts + 1` total requests; every request (initial and corrective) sends the same plain `model`/`messages`/`temperature` payload — no `response_format` or other provider-specific field is ever added; a code-fenced compliant response still parses on the first attempt (no retry needed) |
| `tests/test_provider_workflows.py` | Separate provider evaluation parity, LiteLLM/AWS isolation, OpenAI's fixed endpoint with no dispatch or reusable-workflow endpoint input, Bedrock direct-OIDC and fixed instance-managed credential paths, bounded caller-side credential timeout and surviving gate-3 recovery, caller identity verification wiring, dependency setup, legacy migration guard, fixed-provider configuration callers and their shared local action, provider-relevant dispatch inputs, common concurrency, canonical merge/close token mapping, actionable workflow-summary failure reporting, and raw optional request budgets resolved only after the fixed instance default Action runs |
| `tests/test_naming.py` | Name normalization rules, `panopticon-` hint parsing (including the dependency-indexing capability's `panopticon-dependency`/`panopticon-dependency-of` hint forms via the generalized `nearest_hint(..., hint_type=...)`), CI name-resolution failures; `resolve_dependency_name` deliberately does **not** normalize (no lowercasing/dash-ification) since a dependency's raw name is already a canonical machine identifier — verified separately from `resolve_name`'s normalizing behavior, including that its `UnresolvableNameError` instructs `panopticon-dependency` (never `panopticon-dependency-of`) |
| `tests/test_parsers.py` | Parser registry detection plus the REST/OpenAPI and Kafka starter parsers |
| `tests/test_tooling_currency.py` | Advisory-only tooling-currency PR check (`panopticon/tooling_currency.py`, CI only): `check_workflow_ref`'s ref-resolution against a stubbed `git ls-remote`/`rev-parse` runner (aligned, behind, deleted, and an unparseable caller-workflow file); skills/tooling content drift; instance-excluded versus child-only unmanaged Python-module warnings; state-file exclusion; and `main()`'s always-`0` exit code with findings surfaced as `::warning::` lines (real `git` subprocess calls against a real local git repo used as its own remote, not stubbed, to exercise the actual ref-resolution path end-to-end). |
| `tests/test_sync.py` | Local sync script (`panopticon/sync.py`): git-blob comparisons; staged refresh of the instance-owned manifest's exact module set; remote-manifest precedence over a child copy; CI-only exclusion; unmanaged Python-module warnings (instance-excluded or child-only) with no deletion; dry-run behavior; managed caller reconciliation (missing resource-sync caller, stale provider caller, OpenAI mapping, no-write preview, and graceful missing/non-callable/syntax-invalid fetched or local renderer failures); distinct invalid-provider and unexpected provider-contract failures; and current/uninitialized paths. Runs with `python3 -m unittest tests.test_sync -v`; all tests must pass and use stubbed GitHub API responses, with no network dependency. |
| `tests/test_sync_from_template.py` | Structural checks for the fixed instance caller and template-owned `shared-template-sync-caller-only.yml` reusable workflow: the caller has no redirectable inputs, passes only the explicit optional `PANOPTICON_INSTANCE_TOKEN` mapping, and delegates all merge logic to the fixed `@main` workflow; the shared caller-only workflow has no direct trigger, falls back to the default GitHub token, blocks workflow-file pushes without the token, and prints fixed local recovery commands after a failure. Integration tests use isolated real Git repositories (`subprocess` and `tempfile`, no mocks or network) for `.git/info/attributes` rules: org-declared `protected_paths` survive routine and unrelated-history merges without changing tracked `.gitattributes`; the distinct template-declared `docs/architecture.md` generated path keeps the instance version when both sides independently add it, when both sides modify it, and during an unrelated-history merge with `-X theirs`; a one-sided template placeholder is installed when the instance lacks the file. Prerequisite: system `git`. Pass criterion: every merge exits zero and each asserted path has the expected owner-specific content. No ordering dependency on other test modules. |
| `tests/test_org_diagram_link.py` | Org-diagram link script (`panopticon/org_diagram_link.py`): `build_link`'s exact URL construction (`https://github.com/{instance}/blob/{branch}/docs/architecture.md#{repo}`, non-`main` branch names used verbatim); `resolve_branch`'s config-first-then-live-fallback logic — a `panopticon/config.json` `instance_default_branch` field is used with zero network calls (stubbed `urlopen` that raises if invoked at all proves this), a missing field falls back to a live GitHub API lookup and succeeds, and a missing field plus a failed live lookup raises rather than guessing a branch; `main()`'s stdout output and exit code for the happy path (no network), an uninitialized repo, the live-fallback-succeeds path, and the live-fallback-also-fails path |
| `tests/test_report.py` | Combined-report TL;DR assembly: `dedupe_actions` collapses identical `(kind, target)` pairs regardless of input order and orders by a fixed section order; `render_tldr` interpolates targets into per-kind templates, states "all checks passed" when there are no actions, and — critically — never says "all checks passed" when `has_operational_failure=True`, leading with `FAILURE_NOTICE` instead even when other checks also found real actionable issues; `build_combined_report` puts the same TL;DR at both the start and end of the body with per-check detail sandwiched between, including an operational-failure section shown alongside other checks' real results; `load_actions` returns `[]` for a missing actions file; `format_operational_failure` names the check and includes the failure message |
| `tests/test_recovery.py` | Exact recovery guidance for unconfigured instances, missing provider inputs, stale provider callers, and gate-3 credential failures/timeouts: both provider-specific configuration URLs and CLI commands, child-bootstrap command, configured missing names, per-child identity scope, fixed action path, safe secret-rotation instructions, and private-instance/custom-branch recovery text. |

Fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/`: sample local index documents
(`local_*.json`), local dependency index
documents (`local_dep_*.json`), a `sample_repo/` tree exercised by the interface
parser tests, and
`sample_go_repo/`/`sample_go_repo_no_config/` trees exercised by the Go
dependency parser tests. Tests that
need to write files use `tempfile` and clean up after themselves —
never add fixtures that tests mutate in place.

## Documentation-drift regression coverage

`tests/test_drift.py` verifies that documentation, agent skill/template,
OpenSpec, changelog, and test-only diffs pass without an LLM request. It also
requires each stale finding to cite a changed behavior-bearing file and a
specific required update; invalid, contradictory, or unsupported findings are
operational failures rather than stale-doc verdicts. `tests/test_provider_workflows.py`
checks that LiteLLM, OpenAI, and Bedrock workflows preserve that distinction.

## Architecture link protocol coverage

`tests/test_diagrams.py` checks the generated architecture-navigation protocol:
the child README and architecture overview use the resolver-produced absolute
org-diagram URL, child-local links remain document-relative, and the instance
org diagram uses `{repo}/architecture.md` for a mirrored child architecture
document.

## Shared child resource-sync workflow coverage

`tests/test_install.py` verifies bootstrap wires and refreshes the manual child
resource-sync caller. `tests/test_resource_sync_workflow.py` verifies that the
shared workflow gates instance-token use to the child default branch, refreshes
the existing managed resource set, creates or updates only its open
automation-owned pull request when resources changed, creates a new one after a
prior pull request is merged or closed, and creates no pull request when
current.

## Bedrock onboarding-hardening coverage

The onboarding-hardening change is covered by focused standard-library tests:

- `tests/test_config.py` verifies Bedrock model optionality, explicit Actions-name mapping, organization-variable precedence, instance-default fallback, source-safe unresolved-model failure, optional prerequisite reporting, caller revision changes, and legacy fingerprints that preserve pre-change job-timeout defaults while dropping only the newly introduced Bedrock model default.
- `tests/test_configure_instance.py` verifies `model_default` persists only as the non-secret `llm.defaults.model` field and that the CLI rejects the option for non-Bedrock providers with no write.
- `tests/test_recovery.py` verifies the public example URL, fixed action path, copyable `protected_paths` fragment, child-bootstrap command, automatic-protection note, and credential-free recovery text.
- `tests/test_provider_workflows.py` verifies the Bedrock dispatch/action wiring, inline recovery fallback markers, and public placeholder safety for the credential-action example.
- `tests/test_sync_from_template.py` verifies provider-derived runtime attributes and real Git merges for routine and first-time sync paths.

Run the focused set with:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests.test_config tests.test_configure_instance tests.test_recovery tests.test_provider_workflows tests.test_sync_from_template
```
