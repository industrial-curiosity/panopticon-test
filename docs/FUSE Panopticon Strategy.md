# Glossary

* Interface: a mechanism that can be produced to or consumed from, eg. REST endpoint, queue, gRPC endpoint, etc.
* Panopticon repo: a template repo that contains all the tools needed
* Master repo / Panopticon instance: a private copy of the template repo that also includes its repository documentation and interface index

# New project

The org owner creates a private copy of the Panopticon repo via GitHub’s **Use this template** (GitHub does not allow private forks of public repos; template updates are pulled by adding the template as a git remote). This will be used as the knowledge base for the organization’s repos, as well as for customizing its shared workflows and skills. See docs/setup-guide.md for the full procedure.

Workflows:

* PR evaluation
  * Check repo initialized with Panopticon
  * Check changes in PR reflected in documentation
  * Check interfaces\* for conflicts with master repo
* Merge to master
  * Copy repo docs to master repo
  * Merge local interfaces into interfaces index

# Local

## Initialize documentation

We initialize a repo by running a script that’s run directly from the instance fork.
The script does the following:

* Sets up the repo’s workflows to use the shared workflows. CI consumes the org-level PANOPTICON\_LLM\_API\_KEY, PANOPTICON\_LLM\_ENDPOINT and PANOPTICON\_INSTANCE\_TOKEN secrets — child repos configure no per-repo secrets, and local initialization needs none of them.
* The user’s own agent uses the Panopticon skills to generate the four-layer documentation and the local interface index; the script validates the results.
* Writes `panopticon/config.json` — the initialization flag, which also records repo settings such as the documentation location — only once validation passes.

## Plan

When planning a change, the agent should be able to read the interface\* index (with the github cli or mcp, using the developer’s personal GITHUB\_TOKEN) to verify whether any interface connections are affected.

# PR workflow

* Check repo documentation initialized (does flag file exist)
* Check if code or configuration changes have been made that should affect documentation
* Check if documentation updated accordingly
* Check if interface\* changes conflict with the master repo index

# Merge into master

* Copy docs into master repo’s docs/{repo} folders
* Read interface\* index
* Merge interface changes into the index

# The interfaces\* index

* Each repo includes its own index.
* The repo is the authoritative source for whatever interfaces it owns.
* The index is keyed on the interface name
  * A meaningful name based on its use or function
* Each index key is an array of interface objects
  * Owner (“null” if unknown or manually created infra, otherwise repo and component)
  * Type (eg. kafka, REST, gRPC, S3)
  * Consumer / Producer — each a list of repo objects, where a repo object holds the repo name and that repo’s
    array of source files (creating the interface, configuring instances eg. prod/staging)
* Unknowns / conflicts
  * When a repo is a consumer of external interfaces but not the owner
    * Checks for existing entry, checks to see if its values make sense
    * If it finds a match, ensures its producer/consumer state set correctly
    * If it’s not a clear match, adds a conflict entry
  * When a repo is the owner
    * Checks for existing entry
    * If it finds a match, checks for inaccuracies
    * If it’s not a clear match, adds a conflict entry
  * Conflict entries live only in the master repo’s compiled index (its `conflicts` array, recomputed on every
    rebuild) — a repo’s local index only knows what the repo knows
  * If there are conflicts, log and warn in the CI summary
