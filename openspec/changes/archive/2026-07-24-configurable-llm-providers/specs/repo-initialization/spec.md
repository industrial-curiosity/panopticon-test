## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Child bootstrap validates provider configuration before writing

The child bootstrap installer SHALL fetch and strictly validate the instance's
provider configuration
before selecting a skills location, downloading content, vendoring tooling, or
writing workflows. It SHALL
distinguish an inaccessible config, malformed config, missing provider, unknown
provider, invalid configured
name, and selected workflow absent at `workflow_ref`. Any such failure MUST
leave all child files untouched.

#### Scenario: Instance provider is unset

- **WHEN** child bootstrap reads a valid instance config with no selected
  provider
- **THEN** it exits non-zero with console and CLI instance-configuration
  instructions and writes no child
  files

#### Scenario: Selected provider workflow is absent at the configured ref

- **WHEN** the instance config selects Bedrock but the selected `workflow_ref`
  lacks the registered Bedrock
  workflow
- **THEN** bootstrap fails before writing, names the missing path and ref, and
  explains how to select a ref
  containing the provider workflow

#### Scenario: Instance config cannot be fetched

- **WHEN** the GitHub API cannot retrieve `panopticon.config.json`
- **THEN** bootstrap reports the access or transport failure instead of treating
  it as empty configuration

### Requirement: Child bootstrap generates only the selected provider caller

The child SHALL retain a stable local `.github/workflows/panopticon-pr.yml`
caller. Bootstrap SHALL point
that caller at only the provider workflow selected by live instance
configuration and SHALL emit explicit
canonical input and secret mappings from the configured org-level names, the
exact permissions required by
that provider workflow, the selected trusted credential mode, and the effective
configuration revision. It
SHALL map AWS region and role-ARN variables only for Bedrock `github-oidc` mode.
It SHALL NOT copy
unselected provider workflows into the child or use blanket `secrets: inherit`.

#### Scenario: Bedrock child caller generated

- **WHEN** the instance selects Bedrock and child bootstrap succeeds
- **THEN** the local PR caller references the instance's Bedrock reusable
  workflow, grants `id-token: write`,
  maps the configured instance-token secret and Bedrock variables explicitly,
  and includes the config
  revision

#### Scenario: LiteLLM child caller generated

- **WHEN** the instance selects LiteLLM and child bootstrap succeeds
- **THEN** the local PR caller references only the instance's LiteLLM workflow,
  omits Bedrock-only setup,
  and maps the configured endpoint, model, API-key, and budget names explicitly

#### Scenario: Instance-managed Bedrock child caller generated

- **WHEN** the instance selects Bedrock `instance-managed` credentials and child
  bootstrap succeeds
- **THEN** the local caller records that credential mode, maps no AWS region or
  role-ARN variable, and
  references the selected instance workflow only

### Requirement: Stale caller remediation prints an exact installer command

Every bootstrap or workflow failure caused by stale provider, secret-name,
variable-name, or revision SHALL
explain the cause and print a copy/paste child-bootstrap command using the
resolved instance
slug. The command SHALL set `PANOPTICON_INSTANCE` on the piped Python process
itself, without an `export`,
and SHALL instruct the user to run it from inside the child clone, review and
commit the generated changes,
push them, and rerun or await the PR workflow.

#### Scenario: Renamed instance-token secret leaves old caller empty

- **WHEN** an existing caller maps a removed old instance-token secret name and
  the reusable workflow
  receives an empty canonical token
- **THEN** it fails before instance checkout and prints the exact
  public-installer command for that child’s
  recorded instance plus the commit, push, and rerun instructions

### Requirement: Recovery formatter preserves pre-bootstrap compatibility

The child bootstrap installer SHALL vendor a standard-library recovery formatter
after provider validation
succeeds. Provider workflows SHALL use the shared formatter to render stale or
missing-provider recovery
output. Bootstrap failures that occur before vendoring, and the legacy caller
guard, SHALL render equivalent
self-contained recovery output without importing the child-vendored formatter.

#### Scenario: Successful bootstrap makes the formatter available

- **WHEN** child bootstrap validates the selected provider contract and
  completes successfully
- **THEN** the child repository contains the recovery formatter for subsequent
  provider workflow runs

#### Scenario: Unconfigured instance fails before vendoring

- **WHEN** child bootstrap resolves an instance with no configured provider
- **THEN** it prints complete configuration and child-bootstrap recovery
  instructions without requiring the
  child repository to contain the recovery formatter

#### Scenario: Legacy caller lacks the formatter

- **WHEN** a child generated before recovery-formatting vendoring invokes the
  legacy caller guard
- **THEN** the guard prints complete configuration and child-bootstrap recovery
  instructions without an
  import failure

### Requirement: Template sync uses a shared repairable workflow

The instance `sync-from-template.yml` SHALL be a minimal, fixed caller that
invokes only the template-owned
reusable workflow `.github/workflows/shared-template-sync-caller-only.yml` from
`industrial-curiosity/panopticon-ay-eye@main`. The shared workflow SHALL check
out and update the calling
instance repository, retain the `PANOPTICON_INSTANCE_TOKEN` fallback and
pre-push validation contract, and
keep all merge, protected-path, and recovery logic in the template repository.
The instance caller SHALL
not duplicate that logic or accept a configurable repository, workflow path, or
ref. It SHALL pass the
optional instance-token secret explicitly and SHALL NOT expose either token
value. On every sync failure,
the shared workflow SHALL write a step-summary recovery section with commands
for performing the sync from
a local clone of the instance repository: fetch the fixed template remote,
perform the equivalent merge,
resolve any conflict, review the result, commit, and push. The shared workflow
filename SHALL identify it
as shared and caller-only, and it SHALL accept only `workflow_call` rather than
a direct trigger.

User-facing documentation SHALL explain that the sync preserves every exact path
listed in
`protected_paths`, the protected diagram configuration, and an existing
generated
`docs/architecture.md`. It SHALL also explain that other customized
template-managed files can receive a
template update or produce a merge conflict, and that `protected_paths` does not
protect child-repository
files from `python3 -m panopticon.sync`.

#### Scenario: Shared sync logic is fixed after an instance is created

- **GIVEN** an instance contains the minimal sync caller
- **WHEN** the template fixes its shared reusable sync workflow
- **THEN** the instance's next sync run uses the fixed workflow without copying
  workflow code into the instance

#### Scenario: Ordinary template update without an instance token

- **GIVEN** `PANOPTICON_INSTANCE_TOKEN` is not configured
- **WHEN** the shared workflow merges changes outside `.github/workflows/`
- **THEN** it pushes the update using the default GitHub token

#### Scenario: Workflow update without an instance token

- **GIVEN** `PANOPTICON_INSTANCE_TOKEN` is not configured
- **WHEN** the shared workflow merges a change under `.github/workflows/`
- **THEN** it does not push, emits a concise error, and writes setup
  instructions for a GitHub token secret
  with Contents and Workflows read/write permission

#### Scenario: Shared sync fails

- **WHEN** the shared sync workflow fails during checkout, fetch, merge,
  validation, or push
- **THEN** its step summary contains a local instance-repository recovery
  section with the fixed template
  remote, equivalent merge, conflict-resolution, review, commit, and push
  commands

#### Scenario: Shared sync caller cannot be redirected

- **WHEN** instance configuration or workflow-dispatch input attempts to select
  another sync repository,
  workflow path, or ref
- **THEN** the caller rejects the unsupported configuration and invokes no
  alternative workflow

#### Scenario: Shared workflow is not directly runnable

- **WHEN** a user views the template workflow list
- **THEN** the shared workflow is named `shared-template-sync-caller-only.yml`
  and has no direct trigger
  such as `workflow_dispatch`

#### Scenario: Maintainer protects an instance customization

- **GIVEN** an instance customizes a template-managed skill or workflow
- **WHEN** its maintainer adds that exact path to `protected_paths` and runs the
  template sync
- **THEN** the sync preserves the instance copy and the setup documentation
  explains that the same setting
  does not protect child-repository tooling syncs

#### Scenario: Maintainer has an unprotected instance customization

- **GIVEN** an instance customizes a template-managed file that is absent from
  `protected_paths`
- **WHEN** the template also changes that file during sync
- **THEN** the setup documentation explains that Git may update the file or
  report a merge conflict for
  local resolution

### Requirement: README provides concise project orientation

The README SHALL provide a quickly scannable overview of the project's purpose,
repository roles, primary
workflow, and links to the setup guide and other detailed documentation. It
SHALL use clear sections that
separate at-a-glance orientation from navigation. Detailed setup instructions,
configuration reference,
implementation inventories, and operational procedures SHALL live in
purpose-named documentation files
rather than in the README. The README SHALL NOT include temporary implementation
status, incomplete-work
notes, or feature-wiring details. At the top of the README, it SHALL retain the
project logo and an obvious
link to the organization's architecture documentation. At the end of the README,
it SHALL display a
thumbnail for the specified Panopticon YouTube video that opens
`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIJ9XhBSkI8` in a new browser tab or window.

#### Scenario: New maintainer opens the README

- **WHEN** a maintainer reads the README for the first time
- **THEN** they can understand Panopticon's purpose, the template/instance/child
  roles, and the primary
  lifecycle at a glance, then follow clearly labelled links for setup and deeper
  reference

#### Scenario: Maintainer finds the organization architecture

- **WHEN** a maintainer opens the README
- **THEN** they see the project logo and an obvious link to
  `docs/architecture.md` before the detailed
  orientation and navigation sections

#### Scenario: Reader needs detailed setup or configuration

- **WHEN** a reader needs instructions for configuring an instance,
  synchronizing a template, or using a
  feature in detail
- **THEN** the README directs them to a purpose-named guide instead of embedding
  the detailed procedure

#### Scenario: A feature has incomplete automation

- **WHEN** an implementation detail or workflow integration is incomplete
- **THEN** the README does not include its status, workaround, or follow-up
  description

#### Scenario: Reader reaches the end of the README

- **WHEN** a reader reaches the end of the README
- **THEN** they see the thumbnail at
  `https://img.youtube.com/vi/sIJ9XhBSkI8/hqdefault.jpg` in an anchor
  with `target="_blank"` that opens
  `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIJ9XhBSkI8` in a new browser tab or
  window

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Org-level CI prerequisites

The init tooling SHALL derive required org-level Actions secrets and variables
from the validated instance
provider contract, including the configured instance-token name, provider
credentials, model and endpoint
or selected credential-mode settings, and bounded request/job budget names.
These values are consumed only
by shared CI workflows. Child repos MUST NOT require per-repo secret or variable
configuration; generated
callers SHALL map org-level names explicitly to canonical provider workflow
inputs and secrets. Missing
values SHALL NOT block documentation or index initialization, but provider
configuration itself MUST be
valid before bootstrap writes any child artifact.

Verifying org-level secrets and variables requires a GitHub auth token with
permission to read org-level
Actions secrets and variables. With a resolved `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or
`gh auth token`, tooling SHALL
query the org APIs and report every missing provider-resolved name and its kind.
Without such a token,
tooling SHALL report no auth error and SHALL print the visible org Actions
settings URL plus equivalent
`gh secret list --org` and `gh variable list --org` commands, listing every
provider-resolved name to check.

#### Scenario: Configured instance token is missing

- **GIVEN** a GitHub auth token is available
- **WHEN** initialization checks an org missing the instance-token secret name
  recorded by the instance
- **THEN** it reports that exact org-level secret name and how to configure it

#### Scenario: Configured provider variable is missing

- **GIVEN** a GitHub auth token is available
- **WHEN** initialization checks an org missing a variable required by the
  selected provider contract
- **THEN** it reports that exact variable name and its provider purpose

#### Scenario: Instance-managed credentials need no AWS variables

- **WHEN** initialization checks an instance using Bedrock `instance-managed`
  credentials
- **THEN** it does not report an AWS region or role-ARN variable as a missing
  prerequisite

#### Scenario: Auth token available

- **GIVEN** a GitHub auth token is resolved from `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or
  `gh auth token`
- **WHEN** the org-level prerequisite check runs
- **THEN** it queries the org APIs and reports exactly which provider-resolved
  names are absent

#### Scenario: No auth token available

- **GIVEN** no GitHub auth token can be resolved
- **WHEN** the org-level prerequisite check runs
- **THEN** it prints the visible web UI URL, equivalent listing commands, and
  every provider-resolved secret
  and variable name without treating the missing auth token as an initialization
  failure
