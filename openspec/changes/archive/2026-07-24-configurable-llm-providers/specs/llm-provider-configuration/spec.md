# LLM provider configuration delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Template instances require explicit provider configuration

The template SHALL ship `panopticon.config.json` without a selected LLM
provider. Any child
bootstrap or provider-dependent CI path that reads an instance with no selected
provider MUST fail
loudly before performing provider-dependent work and MUST direct the maintainer
to run the instance's
`Configure Panopticon` workflow. General consumers of unrelated org
configuration, including template
sync, SHALL remain able to load an otherwise valid unconfigured file.

#### Scenario: New instance has no implicit provider

- **WHEN** an instance is created directly from the template
- **THEN** its org configuration contains no selected LLM provider and does not
  silently default to
  LiteLLM, Bedrock, or any other provider

#### Scenario: Provider-dependent operation uses unconfigured instance

- **WHEN** child bootstrap or provider-dependent CI resolves an instance whose
  provider is unset
- **THEN** it exits non-zero before provider-dependent work and identifies
  `Configure Panopticon` as
  the required instance-bootstrap workflow

### Requirement: Instance configuration workflow persists names, never credentials

The template SHALL provide `.github/workflows/configure-panopticon.yml` with a
manual
`workflow_dispatch` interface. It SHALL require a deliberate provider choice
from the supported provider
registry and SHALL accept one independently optional provider-relevant GitHub
Actions secret or variable
*name* input for each configured name, with the documented Panopticon name as
its logical default. It SHALL
describe the instance checkout input as the name of an organization secret
containing a GitHub token and
state that the token needs access to the instance repository. It SHALL describe
the model-variable input
with a concrete example of the variable's value appropriate to the selected
provider. It MUST NOT accept,
print, or persist secret values. It SHALL validate every name and
provider-specific requirement before
deterministically updating `panopticon.config.json`, committing the change, and
summarizing the org-level
values the maintainer must configure. Every dispatch field SHALL identify
whether it accepts a name or a
value, state its purpose, and provide a concrete valid example whenever its
accepted value is not obvious
from its label and default.

#### Scenario: Maintainer configures Bedrock with default names

- **WHEN** the maintainer dispatches `Configure Panopticon`, selects `bedrock`,
  and accepts the
  provider's default secret and variable names
- **THEN** the workflow commits a Bedrock provider contract containing those
  names but no credential
  values

#### Scenario: Maintainer reviews clear optional name inputs

- **WHEN** the maintainer opens `Configure Panopticon`
- **THEN** it presents separate optional inputs for the request timeout,
  transport-attempt,
  correction-attempt, and job-timeout variable names, each prefilled with its
  documented default rather
  than requiring a JSON object, and it identifies the instance-token field as a
  GitHub token secret with
  instance-repository access

#### Scenario: Maintainer sees a model-value example

- **WHEN** the maintainer selects a provider and reviews the model-variable
  input
- **THEN** the workflow explains that the input is the organization variable's
  name and gives a concrete
  example of the value to store in that variable for the selected provider

#### Scenario: Maintainer chooses Bedrock authentication

- **WHEN** the maintainer selects Bedrock
- **THEN** the workflow presents clearly labelled choices for a GitHub OIDC role
  and an
  instance-managed credential action, explaining the configuration each choice
  requires

#### Scenario: Maintainer leaves the provider sentinel selected

- **WHEN** the configuration workflow is dispatched without replacing its
  non-provider sentinel choice
- **THEN** it fails without changing `panopticon.config.json` and tells the
  maintainer to select a
  supported provider

#### Scenario: Input contains a secret value instead of a name

- **WHEN** a configured name is blank, malformed, or does not satisfy the
  accepted GitHub Actions
  identifier rules
- **THEN** the workflow rejects the input before writing or logging it as
  configuration

### Requirement: Configuration workflow failures have actionable summaries

The `Configure Panopticon` workflow SHALL write the detected validation or
persistence failure reason and
the corrective action to the GitHub Actions step summary before it exits
non-zero. Its concise workflow
annotation SHALL direct the maintainer to that summary. The summary SHALL not
expose credential values.

#### Scenario: Invalid configuration input

- **WHEN** a maintainer dispatches the workflow with an invalid provider or
  configured name
- **THEN** the workflow exits non-zero without changing
  `panopticon.config.json`, and its step summary
  identifies the invalid input and instructs the maintainer to correct the
  dispatch values and rerun

### Requirement: Configuration workflow imports checked-out tooling

The configuration workflow SHALL expose the checked-out workspace on the inline
Python step's import path
before importing Panopticon configuration modules, so the validation and
persistence step SHALL run against
the checked-out implementation on a clean GitHub Actions runner.

#### Scenario: Clean runner imports the configuration module

- **GIVEN** the workflow has checked out an instance repository containing the
  Panopticon package
- **WHEN** the `Validate and persist provider names` step starts on a clean
  runner
- **THEN** its inline Python process imports `panopticon.configure_instance`
  successfully before validating
  the dispatch inputs

### Requirement: Provider contracts select separate reusable workflows

The provider registry SHALL map each supported provider to a template-owned
reusable PR workflow and
its logical secret, variable, input, dependency, and permission contract.
LiteLLM and Bedrock SHALL be
separate reusable workflows. The configuration file SHALL store the provider
identifier and configurable
names but SHALL NOT accept an arbitrary workflow path; child bootstrap SHALL
derive the workflow path
from the trusted registry.

#### Scenario: Bedrock provider selected

- **WHEN** child bootstrap resolves a valid `bedrock` provider contract
- **THEN** it selects the template-defined Bedrock reusable PR workflow and
  cannot be redirected to an
  arbitrary workflow path by org configuration

#### Scenario: Unknown provider configured

- **WHEN** `panopticon.config.json` contains a provider identifier absent from
  the registry
- **THEN** provider validation fails loudly, names the unknown value and
  supported providers, and writes
  no child workflow

### Requirement: Bedrock authentication supports trusted organization choices

The Bedrock provider contract SHALL persist one selected credential mode from a
closed registry. In
`github-oidc` mode, it SHALL require an AWS region variable and an AWS IAM
role-ARN variable, and the
configuration interface SHALL explain that the role is assumed through GitHub
OIDC and is not a Bedrock
model or inference-profile ARN. In `instance-managed` mode, it SHALL require
neither variable and SHALL
invoke only the fixed instance-local credential action
`.github/actions/panopticon-aws-credentials/action.yml`. That action SHALL
provide temporary AWS
credentials and the canonical Bedrock region environment before provider
preflight. Configuration SHALL
not select an arbitrary action path.

#### Scenario: Organization uses a GitHub OIDC role

- **WHEN** an organization selects `github-oidc` for Bedrock
- **THEN** it configures an AWS region such as `us-east-1` and an IAM role ARN
  such as
  `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/panopticon-bedrock`, and the provider workflow
  assumes that role through
  GitHub OIDC

#### Scenario: Organization manages credentials in its instance

- **WHEN** an organization selects `instance-managed` for Bedrock and provides
  the fixed credential action
- **THEN** its provider workflow invokes that action without requiring an
  org-level AWS region or role-ARN
  variable

#### Scenario: Instance-managed credential action is absent

- **WHEN** an organization selects `instance-managed` but its instance lacks the
  fixed credential action
- **THEN** bootstrap or provider evaluation fails before LLM work and names the
  required action path

#### Scenario: Configuration attempts to override the credential action

- **WHEN** instance configuration supplies an action path or other
  credential-action override
- **THEN** provider validation rejects the configuration before child bootstrap
  writes a workflow

### Requirement: Provider configuration has a deterministic revision

The effective provider contract SHALL have a deterministic revision derived from
all caller-relevant
provider, secret-name, variable-name, workflow, and permission settings. Child
callers SHALL record and
pass that revision. Provider workflows SHALL compare it with the live instance
configuration and MUST
fail loudly when they differ rather than continuing under stale wiring.

#### Scenario: Secret name changes after child bootstrap

- **WHEN** an instance maintainer changes a configured secret name and an
  existing child invokes a caller
  generated from the prior revision
- **THEN** the provider workflow fails as stale and directs the user to rerun
  child bootstrap

#### Scenario: Provider configuration is unchanged

- **WHEN** the generated caller revision matches the effective live instance
  contract
- **THEN** provider evaluation proceeds normally

### Requirement: Unconfigured-instance remediation supports console and CLI paths

Every unconfigured-provider failure intended for a maintainer SHALL print both a
direct GitHub Actions
console URL for the resolved instance's `Configure Panopticon` workflow and an
equivalent copy/paste
`gh workflow run` command using the resolved instance slug and default branch.
It SHALL then print an exact
one-line public installer command with `PANOPTICON_INSTANCE` applied directly to
the Python process, without
requiring a preceding `export`.

#### Scenario: Bootstrap reports an unconfigured private instance

- **WHEN** child bootstrap resolves `acme/panopticon-instance` on default branch
  `main` with no provider
- **THEN** its remediation includes
  `https://github.com/acme/panopticon-instance/actions/workflows/configure-panopticon.yml`,
  a corresponding
  `gh workflow run` command, ordered console instructions, and
  `curl -fsSL

  | PANOPTICON_INSTANCE='acme/panopticon-instance' python3`
