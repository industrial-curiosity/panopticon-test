# Configurable LLM providers design

## Context

Panopticon's CI LLM client currently assumes one OpenAI-compatible transport,
fixed Actions names, and an
implicit LiteLLM-compatible deployment. A production instance proved that native
Bedrock through GitHub
OIDC requires a provider SDK, different authentication and message mapping,
additional caller permissions,
and isolated Python setup. The existing child installer already fetches instance
configuration and generates
thin reusable-workflow callers, but it silently converts every org-config fetch
failure to an empty object
and assumes local and remote workflow filenames match.

This design makes provider selection an explicit instance-bootstrap operation.
The template remains
unconfigured, while a manual workflow persists a validated provider contract.
Child bootstrap compiles that
contract into a stable local PR caller pointing to one independent provider
workflow in the instance.

## Goals / Non-Goals

## Goals

- Make LiteLLM and native Bedrock/OIDC work without instance forks.
- Require an explicit provider choice and retain organization-specific secret
  and variable naming.
- Keep child workflows thin, generated, and free of provider implementations.
- Preserve the shared LLM client behavior and complete PR evaluation semantics
  across provider workflows.
- Fail before mutation on invalid instance configuration and fail stale callers
  with copy/paste recovery.
- Keep Bedrock's SDK and setup isolated from LiteLLM jobs, child tooling, and
  local agent flows.

## Non-Goals

- Runtime-installable third-party provider plugins.
- Per-child provider selection; one instance contract applies organization-wide.
- Automatic creation or mutation of org secrets, variables, AWS roles, or OIDC
  trust policies.
- Copying full provider workflows into child repositories.
- Abstracting provider workflows into a generic workflow-hook or arbitrary
  workflow-path mechanism.
- Replacing local agent-harness execution with Panopticon CI credentials.

## Decisions

### D1: Instance config is authoritative and initially unconfigured

The template omits the `llm` provider block. `load_org_config` continues to load
unrelated defaults so
template sync and configuration can operate, while a separate strict provider
resolver rejects missing or
invalid provider state wherever it is required. This avoids making general
config parsing unusable before
bootstrap while ensuring no provider silently wins.

Alternative considered: default to LiteLLM for compatibility. Rejected because
it recreates the accidental
configuration this change is intended to eliminate.

### D2: A manual workflow writes names, not values

`.github/workflows/configure-panopticon.yml` exposes a sentinel provider choice
plus separate optional
name inputs with provider-specific defaults. It identifies the instance-token
input as the name of a
GitHub-token secret with instance-repository access, and gives a
provider-appropriate example model value
alongside the model-variable-name input. An importable standard-library module
validates and normalizes the document; the workflow checks out the instance,
invokes that module, commits only `panopticon.config.json`, and writes the next
setup steps to its summary. Secret values remain solely in GitHub Actions
secrets and never appear in dispatch inputs, logs, commits, or outputs.
Because GitHub Actions executes inline `shell: python` blocks from temporary
files, the configuration step
sets `PYTHONPATH` to the checked-out workspace before importing the module.

The provider registry owns workflow paths, logical fields, defaults,
permissions, and dependency metadata.
Configuration stores the selected provider and name overrides, not an executable
workflow path.

### D2a: Template sync calls shared template logic

Every instance keeps only a minimal `sync-from-template.yml` caller, fixed to
invoke the template's
`shared-template-sync-caller-only.yml@main` reusable workflow. Its explicit
`shared` and `caller-only`
filename prevents it being mistaken for a directly runnable instance workflow.
The shared workflow performs checkout, merge,
protected-path handling, token fallback, and recovery summaries against the
calling instance repository.
Referencing `@main` is intentional: a template fix must be usable by the next
instance sync without a local
workflow copy or instance-template merge first. The fixed repository, workflow
path, and ref prevent an
instance configuration from redirecting privileged sync execution to an
arbitrary workflow.

The shared workflow prefers `PANOPTICON_INSTANCE_TOKEN` because GitHub requires
a PAT with Contents and
Workflows write permission to push workflow-file changes. When the secret is
absent, it uses the workflow's
default token for ordinary updates and rejects pending workflow-file changes
before push with concise setup
instructions. Existing instances need a one-time replacement of the old direct
workflow with the minimal
caller; after that migration, future shared-workflow fixes require no copy step.

Sync protection is deliberately path-based. The instance's `protected_paths`,
the protected diagram
configuration, and an existing generated `docs/architecture.md` retain the
instance version; other
template-managed customizations can merge normally or conflict when both sides
change them. This applies
only to template-to-instance sync: child-repository `python3 -m panopticon.sync`
retains its own managed-file
overwrite behavior. The setup documentation makes that boundary explicit before
an organization relies on
the protection.

Every shared-workflow failure writes local recovery instructions to the step
summary. The instructions use
the fixed template remote and cover fetching, equivalent merge, conflict
resolution, review, commit, and
push from a local clone of the instance repository. This keeps the escape hatch
usable even when hosted CI
cannot complete the sync.

### D2b: README is an orientation layer

The README gives a new maintainer a short, navigable mental model: its
established logo and a prominent
organization-architecture link at the top, Panopticon's purpose, the template,
instance, and child roles,
the primary lifecycle, and links to purpose-named detailed guides. It does not
duplicate setup procedures,
enumerate implementation internals, or track incomplete feature wiring. Those
details either belong in a
focused guide or are omitted when they are only transient implementation state.
The end of the README displays a thumbnail that opens the specified Panopticon
YouTube video in a new
browser tab or window, providing an optional visual introduction without
displacing the concise written
orientation. GitHub README rendering does not support playable iframe embeds.

### D3: Provider workflows are independent reusable entrypoints

The instance contains `panopticon-pr-litellm.yml` and
`panopticon-pr-bedrock.yml`. Each declares canonical
inputs and secrets and owns the full PR evaluation job, including its provider
setup and permissions. The
stable child-local `panopticon-pr.yml` points to exactly one of them. Merge and
PR-close remain
provider-independent.

This accepts some YAML duplication. Provider-independent Python behavior remains
shared, while tests assert
that both entrypoints preserve the required PR phases, exit-code handling,
reporting, and gating. A generic
nested workflow was rejected because a portable template cannot dynamically
self-reference the future
private instance slug/ref in `jobs.<id>.uses`, and credentials or step state
cannot be passed from a provider
setup job into a different reusable-workflow job.

### D3a: Bedrock credentials have two trusted modes

Bedrock configuration chooses either `github-oidc` or `instance-managed`. The
first maps an AWS region and
an IAM role ARN into `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`, which assumes the
role through GitHub OIDC.
The second invokes the fixed checked-out instance action at
`.github/actions/panopticon-aws-credentials/action.yml`; that action owns any
organization-specific
credential setup and exports temporary credentials plus the canonical Bedrock
region. The path is fixed,
not configured, so organizations can adapt their own credential mechanisms
without turning provider
configuration into an arbitrary-action execution surface.

### D4: Generated callers map configured names explicitly

Bootstrap evolves from a tuple of matching filenames to logical caller
definitions. For the PR role it
selects the remote provider filename, emits that workflow's exact permission
set, passes variable values as
canonical `with` inputs, and maps configured org secret names to canonical
`workflow_call.secrets` names.
It does not use `secrets: inherit`. Provider-independent merge and close callers
use the configured instance
token name but retain their existing remote targets.

The installer fetches and validates the provider contract and verifies the
selected provider workflow exists
at the effective `workflow_ref` before prompting or writing. `fetch_org_config`
stops swallowing errors.

### D5: Caller-relevant configuration is revisioned

A canonical JSON serialization of effective provider identifier, workflow,
permissions, logical names, and
contract version is hashed. Bootstrap embeds the revision as a required workflow
input. After child checkout
and before provider work, the reusable workflow reads live instance config and
compares revisions. A mismatch
is an operational failure requiring bootstrap regeneration.

An empty renamed instance-token mapping can prevent instance checkout, so
validation of the canonical token
input happens first and uses the child repo's recorded instance identity for
remediation. Safe secret-name
rotation therefore keeps the old secret available until callers are regenerated;
failure remains explicit if
that order is not followed.

### D6: Recovery text is a tested interface

Unconfigured-provider output contains:

1. The resolved direct Actions URL for `configure-panopticon.yml`.
2. Ordered UI steps naming **Run workflow**, the branch selector, provider
   choice, name fields, and success
   condition.
3. An equivalent `gh workflow run` command and a command to observe completion.
4. The exact child bootstrap one-liner:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/industrial-curiosity/panopticon-ay-eye/main/install.py | PANOPTICON_INSTANCE='acme/panopticon-instance' python3
   ```

Stale-caller output uses the same one-liner and explicitly instructs the user to
run it inside the child
clone, review generated changes, commit, push, and rerun or await CI. The
instance slug and branch are
substituted dynamically. Detailed recovery lives in the step summary;
`::error::` remains one concise line.
Tests assert commands and URLs, not vague keywords.

Every explicit CI failure path follows the same reporting contract: write the
detected cause and a concrete
recovery action to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` before emitting its concise `::error::`
annotation and exiting
non-zero. This applies to configuration, provider evaluation, merge sync, and
PR-close workflows so the
workflow summary remains useful even when a later reporting step cannot run.

The formatter is a standard-library module vendored by a successful child
bootstrap, so current provider
workflows can use one implementation for their recovery summaries. It cannot be
a prerequisite of bootstrap
validation or the legacy caller guard: both must recover children that predate
the module. Those pre-vendoring
paths retain minimal self-contained recovery rendering with the same command
contract.

### D7: LiteLLM transport is extracted; Bedrock is a lazy CI-only adapter

The current HTTP behavior moves behind a LiteLLM adapter without request or
response changes. The Bedrock
adapter maps system and conversation turns to Converse, maps inference
configuration and response text, and
classifies provider errors into existing runtime exceptions. The shared
structured-response correction loop
stays above both.

Bedrock lazily imports a pinned AWS SDK. Only its workflow runs
`actions/setup-python` and a single
`pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` setup before preflight. The
dependency is never included in
`LOCAL_TOOLING_MODULES`. This deliberately narrows the architecture rule
prohibiting provider SDKs: the core
and child contract remain standard-library-first, while a built-in CI adapter
may justify one pinned SDK.

### D8: Provider preflight is centralized

Each adapter implements a preflight. Bedrock constructs the runtime client and
verifies Converse support,
reporting resolved SDK version and import path on failure. LiteLLM validates its
mapped configuration; it
does not make an extra billable inference request. Preflight runs once before
the independent LLM checks.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Separate provider workflows can drift] → Add parity tests for common PR
  phases and keep substantive
  provider-independent logic in Python modules.
- [Configuration workflow cannot verify org secret values] → Validate names,
  print exact setup requirements,
  and retain bootstrap's report-only org API check when suitable auth exists.
- [Default-branch protection can reject the configuration commit] → Fail with
  the exact generated diff and
  local/PR recovery instructions; never claim configuration succeeded without a
  committed file.
- [Provider or name changes leave existing child callers stale] → Compare
  deterministic revisions and retain
  the legacy guard and old provider entrypoints as loud migration surfaces.
- [Removing an old instance-token secret blocks live-config checkout] → Validate
  the canonical token before
  checkout and print the child installer command from recorded child config.
- [Bedrock models differ in Converse support] → Require an explicit model
  identifier and fail during provider
  preflight or the first classified provider request with model-specific
  guidance.
- [A third-party SDK weakens checkout-and-run simplicity] → Pin it, install it
  only in the Bedrock workflow
  under `actions/setup-python`, and verify its resolved capability and import
  path.

## Migration Plan

1. Ship the configuration workflow, provider schema/registry, independent
   provider workflows, and legacy
   guard before enforcing provider selection for existing callers.
2. Have instance maintainers sync the preparatory release and run `Configure
   Panopticon`; existing LiteLLM
   users explicitly select LiteLLM and may retain current Actions names.
3. Enable strict provider enforcement and provider-aware child caller
   generation.
4. Rerun the bootstrap installer in each child, commit and push generated caller
   updates, and keep any renamed
   old instance-token secret available until this completes.
5. Confirm provider workflows pass preflight and PR evaluation before removing
   obsolete secret names or
   retiring compatibility workflow versions.

Rollback retains the committed provider config and restores prior caller
targets/workflow ref. Do not remove
legacy/provider workflows or old secret names until every child is confirmed
regenerated; doing so would
turn an actionable runtime guard into a workflow-load or empty-secret failure.

## Open Questions

None. Provider scope, separate workflow entrypoints, instance-owned
configuration, explicit name mapping,
and recovery-command behavior were resolved during exploration.
