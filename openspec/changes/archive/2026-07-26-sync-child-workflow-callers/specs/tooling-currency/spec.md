## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Local sync script

The template repo SHALL provide a script, runnable from an already-bootstrapped
child repo with no instance repo clone (`python3 -m panopticon.sync` or
equivalent), that reconciles complete managed resource directories from the
instance's current default branch. The script SHALL stage each managed directory
before applying it, so every module required by the refreshed sync entrypoint is
available together. It SHALL NOT use a per-module allowlist for the managed
`panopticon/` directory.

The script SHALL preserve protected child paths, including
`panopticon/config.json`, `panopticon/.gitignore`, and child-owned workflow
files. It SHALL create or refresh Panopticon-managed caller workflows from the
single shared caller contract and SHALL NOT overwrite or delete unrecognized
child workflow files. The script SHALL NOT delete any child-repository file,
including a managed resource that no longer exists in the instance source.

Given a `--check-updates` flag, the script SHALL run as a pure dry run: it SHALL
report every directory-derived resource that would change or be protected, using
content-based comparison, and SHALL NOT write any file.

#### Scenario: New sync dependency arrives with the managed directory

- **GIVEN** the instance adds a module required by a refreshed sync entrypoint
- **WHEN** local sync refreshes the managed `panopticon/` directory
- **THEN** the entrypoint and its new dependency are installed as one staged
  resource set before the refreshed entrypoint is used

#### Scenario: Default run refreshes a missing resource-sync caller

- **GIVEN** an initialized child lacks
  `.github/workflows/panopticon-resource-sync.yml`
- **WHEN** local sync runs without flags
- **THEN** it creates the generated caller without rerunning bootstrap

#### Scenario: Protected child workflow is retained

- **GIVEN** a child repository contains a workflow not managed by Panopticon
- **WHEN** local sync refreshes workflows
- **THEN** it does not modify or delete that workflow

#### Scenario: Removed instance resource remains in the child repository

- **GIVEN** a file previously synchronized into a managed directory is no
  longer present in the instance source
- **WHEN** local sync runs
- **THEN** it does not delete that child file

#### Scenario: Invalid instance provider configuration fails before caller writes

- **GIVEN** the child can read its local configuration but the instance provider
  configuration is absent or invalid
- **WHEN** local sync runs
- **THEN** it exits with a configuration error and does not write managed caller
  workflows
