## Why

A child repo's wired workflow ref, its downloaded `panopticon-*` skills, and its vendored local
tooling (`panopticon/{__init__,config,docs,index,init_repo}.py`) are all snapshots taken at
bootstrap time (`install.py`). Nothing currently notices when they drift from what the instance
repo now ships — `docs/planned-work.md` already names this gap ("workflows should check that
skills and workflows are up to date with the instance repo"). A repo can silently run stale
doc-generation rules, a stale index schema understanding, or a workflow pointer nobody remembers
pinning, with no signal short of a maintainer manually re-running `install.py` and diffing by eye.
Separately, an org may customize a `panopticon-*` skill or tooling module at the **instance** repo
level (and, in the future, ship plugin content) — that customization needs to survive
`sync-from-template`'s pull from the upstream template, extending the protected-config mechanism
built for `panopticon.diagram.config.json` to arbitrary, org-declared paths.

## What Changes

- A new deterministic, advisory-only PR check (`panopticon-pr.yml`) warns when a child repo's
  wired `panopticon-pr.yml` `uses:@ref` no longer resolves to the instance repo's current
  default-branch tip commit, and separately when the child's downloaded skills or vendored local
  tooling differ in content from the instance repo's current copies. Both comparisons run against
  the instance repo already checked out by that workflow — no GitHub API calls, no tag
  enumeration, no timestamp comparisons (CI checkout mtimes don't reflect commit history and would
  be actively misleading as a staleness signal). This check never fails the workflow: it is
  explicitly left to "the child repo maintainer's discretion," and is not wired into the existing
  `CHECK_TYPES`/gating mechanism.
- A new local script, vendored alongside the existing local-tooling subset so it's available
  immediately in any already-bootstrapped child repo, lets a developer pull the instance's current
  skills and tooling on demand. Default behavior overwrites unconditionally (git review is the
  safety net, same trust model as `install.py`'s existing idempotent overwrite of vendored
  tooling); `--check-updates` makes it a pure dry run — reports what would change using the same
  git-blob-hash comparison GitHub's API already exposes, writes nothing.
- `panopticon.config.json` gains a new org-declared `protected_paths` field — arbitrary paths
  (skills, tooling modules, future plugin content) an org has customized at the instance level.
  `sync-from-template.yml` gains a step, run before `git merge`, that writes these paths (each with
  the `merge=ours` attribute) into `.git/info/attributes` — never the tracked `.gitattributes`,
  never committed — so this protection can never abort a merge the way an uncommitted change to a
  *tracked* file the incoming side also touches does (verified empirically; see design.md). The
  tracked `.gitattributes` is untouched by this change and keeps carrying only the
  template-declared baseline (`PROTECTED_CONFIG_FILES`) exactly as already built. Because the
  protected-path list is no longer visible in the tracked tree, the workflow step prints which
  paths it protected this run to the GitHub Actions step summary.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `tooling-currency`: owns what "in sync with the instance repo" means for a child repo's wired
  workflow ref, downloaded skills, and vendored local tooling — the comparison semantics (content,
  never timestamps), the always-advisory nature of the CI check, and the local sync script's
  default-overwrite / `--check-updates`-is-dry-run-only contract — that `pr-evaluation` and
  `repo-initialization` each hook into, mirroring how `architecture-diagrams` owns diagram content
  contracts that other capabilities consume.

### Modified Capabilities

- `repo-initialization`: `sync-from-template.yml`'s protected-config mechanism (design D7 of the
  `architecture-diagrams` change) generalizes from a template-declared, single-entry registry to
  also cover an org-declared, open-ended `protected_paths` list, protected via `.git/info/attributes`
  regenerated every run rather than the tracked `.gitattributes`; the local-tooling vendoring list
  gains the new sync script so it's available in any already-bootstrapped child repo.
- `pr-evaluation`: adds the tooling-currency check's CI wiring (workflow-ref alignment,
  skills/tooling diff) as a new, always-advisory step — distinct from the existing combined report
  and its TL;DR action-collapsing, since remediation here ("run the sync script") doesn't fit that
  report's doc-generation-centric action vocabulary and nothing here is a gate a developer must
  clear before merge.

## Impact

- **Code**: `panopticon/config.py` (`protected_paths` schema), a new `panopticon/sync.py` (or
  equivalent name settled in design) implementing the local sync script, `panopticon/bootstrap.py`
  (`LOCAL_TOOLING_MODULES` gains the new script).
- **Workflows**: `panopticon-pr.yml` (two new advisory-only steps: workflow-ref alignment,
  skills/tooling diff), `sync-from-template.yml` (new `.git/info/attributes` regeneration step with
  step-summary visibility, run before the merge step).
- **Docs**: `docs/setup-guide.md`, `README.md`, `docs/testing.md` — the sync script's usage, the
  CI warning's meaning and remediation, and the `protected_paths` config field all need to be
  documented clearly, per explicit requirement.
- **No breaking changes**: purely additive. No new `CHECK_TYPES`/gating entry (this check is
  deliberately never gated). No changes to the index schema or existing protected-config behavior
  for `panopticon.diagram.config.json`, which keeps working exactly as `architecture-diagrams`
  built it.
