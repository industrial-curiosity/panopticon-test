### Requirement: Four documentation layers

Doc generation SHALL produce four layers per repo: an architecture overview (purpose, components, data flow,
dependencies), per-component docs following a fixed template, interface docs, and operational docs (how to
run/deploy/test, required configuration). Generated docs SHALL live in the repo's configured documentation
location (adopted or chosen at initialization and recorded in `panopticon/config.json`) so the sync
workflow can copy them to `docs/{repo}/` in the instance repo. Generation and doc updating SHALL be
defined as harness-portable agent skills, so that local runs execute in the user's preferred AI agent harness
with no Panopticon LLM configuration.

#### Scenario: Local doc update through the user's harness

- **WHEN** a user updates a repo's docs locally using the bundled skills in their own agent harness
- **THEN** the four-layer structure and templates are honored without `PANOPTICON_LLM_*` configuration

#### Scenario: Initial generation

- **WHEN** doc generation runs on a repo during initialization
- **THEN** all four layers exist in the repo's docs location, each following its template

### Requirement: Interface docs rendered from the index

Interface docs SHALL be a human-readable rendering of the repo's local interface index (deterministic
rendering, not LLM prose), so that interface docs can never disagree with the index.

#### Scenario: Index and interface docs stay consistent

- **WHEN** the local index changes and docs are regenerated
- **THEN** the interface docs reflect exactly the entries in the updated index

### Requirement: Doc-vs-code drift detection

The tooling SHALL provide an LLM-based drift check that, given a PR's code/configuration changes and the
current docs, judges whether documentation updates are required — developers keep their repo's docs and index
up to date locally with their own agents, and CI verifies that they have. When docs are stale the check SHALL
fail loudly and clearly, and the GitHub Actions step summary SHALL contain concrete, actionable remediation
instructions, not just a description of the problem: for each stale doc, which doc it is, why it's stale, and
the exact command or skill that fixes it (`panopticon-doc-generation`, or the specific `python3 -m
panopticon.docs` command for interface docs). The summary SHALL also state, in plain terms, that the fix must
be committed and pushed to this same PR's branch — not a new PR — and that the check re-runs automatically
on that push. Org gating configuration MAY downgrade the check to advisory.

#### Scenario: Code change affecting documented behavior

- **WHEN** a PR changes a component's public behavior without touching its docs
- **THEN** the drift check fails, and both the GitHub Actions summary and the PR comment name which docs are
  stale, why, the exact regeneration command or skill for each, and that pushing the fix to this branch
  re-triggers the check

#### Scenario: Docs updated alongside code

- **WHEN** a PR updates docs consistently with its code changes
- **THEN** the drift check passes and says so in the CI summary

#### Scenario: Remediation instructions are self-contained

- **GIVEN** a developer who has never seen a Panopticon doc-drift failure before
- **WHEN** they read only the GitHub Actions step summary, with no other context
- **THEN** they can tell exactly which doc(s) to fix, why, and the precise steps to resolve and re-trigger
  the check, without needing to consult any documentation outside the summary itself

### Requirement: Regeneration updates in place

Doc regeneration SHALL update the existing generated docs in place, preserving the layer structure, and MUST
NOT create parallel copies or leave stale sections for removed components.

#### Scenario: Component removed from codebase

- **WHEN** docs are regenerated after a component is deleted
- **THEN** that component's per-component doc is removed and references to it are gone from the overview

### Requirement: Initialization-time drift resolution

During initialization (interface naming, interface extraction, and doc generation — all run locally via the
user's own agent harness, with full repo context and write access), when the tooling discovers that existing
repository documentation contradicts the actual current state of the repository — describing code,
configuration, or interfaces that have since changed, been removed, or were never actually implemented as
documented — it SHALL resolve the contradiction by revising the affected documentation to match the current
repo state, rather than pausing on every such mismatch. The revised documentation's prose SHALL NOT call out
the resolution inline. Instead, each resolved contradiction SHALL be recorded as an entry appended to a
Panopticon changelog file (`panopticon-changelog.md`, in the repo's configured documentation location)
naming the doc, what was found, and how it was resolved — visible to maintainers without cluttering the
generated docs themselves. The changelog file is an ordinary generated artifact: Panopticon SHALL NOT stage,
commit, or push it automatically; whether to keep, edit, or discard it is the user's call at their own
commit step, same as every other file initialization produces. When the correct resolution is ambiguous —
intent cannot be determined from the repo alone, such as work that was planned but never finished, or
genuinely conflicting signals — the tooling SHALL stop and prompt the user for intervention rather than
guessing.

This is distinct from the "Doc-vs-code drift detection" requirement: that check runs on PR diffs in CI and
only reports a verdict, never editing docs, because CI has no mandate to silently rewrite a developer's
documentation. This requirement governs the local, agent-driven initialization flow only, which has full
repo context and write access and can actually repair drift it discovers rather than only flag it.

#### Scenario: Doc describes a component that no longer matches the code

- **GIVEN** a repo's existing documentation describes an interface or component whose actual implementation
  has since diverged (renamed, removed, or restructured)
- **WHEN** initialization runs and this mismatch is discovered
- **THEN** the documentation is revised to match the current code with no inline callout, and a new entry
  describing the mismatch and its resolution is appended to `panopticon-changelog.md` in the docs location

#### Scenario: Documented interface was never actually implemented

- **GIVEN** a repo's documentation describes an interface backed by source files that don't exist anywhere in
  the repo, with nothing else in the repo clarifying whether the work is still pending
- **WHEN** initialization runs and finds no source-file evidence for that interface
- **THEN** the tooling stops and prompts the user for how to proceed, rather than fabricating the missing
  interface or silently dropping it from the docs

#### Scenario: Ambiguous resolution prompts the user

- **GIVEN** documentation drift where the correct resolution cannot be determined solely from the repo's
  current state
- **WHEN** initialization encounters this drift
- **THEN** it presents the ambiguity to the user with the available options and does not proceed until the
  user decides

#### Scenario: Changelog is left for the user to commit or discard

- **GIVEN** initialization has resolved one or more documentation contradictions and appended entries to
  `panopticon-changelog.md`
- **WHEN** initialization finishes
- **THEN** the changelog file exists in the docs location as an ordinary uncommitted file — Panopticon SHALL
  NOT stage, commit, or push it — and the user decides whether to keep, edit, or discard it at their own
  commit step
