# Agent runtime

## Purpose

Define the provider-agnostic LLM runtime used by Panopticon CI checks.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Provider-agnostic LLM configuration for CI

The agent runtime SHALL remain the execution path for LLM tasks in CI workflows
only. Its prompting, structured-response validation, correction loop, bounded
transport retry behavior, and public client surface SHALL remain provider-neutral.
The selected reusable provider workflow SHALL translate its canonical inputs and
secrets into the runtime configuration required by its adapter. The LiteLLM
adapter SHALL preserve the existing OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` request
and response behavior. The OpenAI adapter SHALL use the fixed
`https://api.openai.com/v1` base endpoint and the same request and response
behavior without accepting an endpoint environment variable. The Bedrock adapter
SHALL use AWS Bedrock Converse with OIDC-provided temporary credentials and
provider-native message, response, and error mapping, and SHALL omit
provider-unsupported optional inference parameters from native requests by
default. A provider adapter MAY use a narrowly scoped, pinned, CI-only SDK;
provider SDKs MUST NOT become a dependency of child-vendored tooling or local
agent flows.

#### Scenario: Configured LiteLLM workflow

- **WHEN** a child invokes the selected LiteLLM reusable workflow with a
  reachable endpoint, valid API
  key, and model input
- **THEN** the runtime completes requests with the existing OpenAI-compatible
  transport and shared client
  semantics

#### Scenario: Configured OpenAI workflow

- **WHEN** a child invokes the selected OpenAI reusable workflow with a valid
  OpenAI Platform API key and model input
- **THEN** the runtime completes requests using the same OpenAI-compatible
  request and response semantics against `https://api.openai.com/v1` while
  identifying the provider as OpenAI

#### Scenario: Configured Bedrock workflow

- **WHEN** a child invokes the selected Bedrock reusable workflow with a valid
  OIDC role, AWS region, and
  Converse-compatible model identifier
- **THEN** the runtime completes requests through Bedrock Converse while
  retaining the same shared
  prompting, retry, validation, and exception contracts

#### Scenario: Bedrock request omits unsupported inference parameters

- **WHEN** the Bedrock adapter receives a shared temperature argument
- **THEN** its Converse request omits `inferenceConfig.temperature` and any
  other unconfirmed optional inference parameter

#### Scenario: Provider-specific dependency remains CI-only

- **WHEN** the Bedrock adapter introduces a pinned AWS SDK dependency
- **THEN** only the Bedrock CI workflow installs it and no child bootstrap or
  local agent flow requires it

### Requirement: Local execution through the user's agent harness

LLM-dependent local tasks (child-repo initialization doc generation and subsequent doc updating) SHALL be executable as skills in the user's preferred AI agent harness, and local
execution MUST NOT require
`PANOPTICON_LLM_ENDPOINT` or `PANOPTICON_LLM_API_KEY` to be configured. Only CI
workflows SHALL depend on the
runtime's endpoint/key configuration.

#### Scenario: Local initialization without Panopticon LLM configuration

- **WHEN** a user runs initialization locally through their own agent harness
  with no `PANOPTICON_LLM_*`
  variables set
- **THEN** doc generation and other LLM-dependent initialization steps complete
  through the harness using the
  bundled skills

#### Scenario: CI uses the configured runtime

- **WHEN** an LLM-dependent check runs in a CI workflow
- **THEN** it executes through the runtime configured via
  `PANOPTICON_LLM_ENDPOINT` and
  `PANOPTICON_LLM_API_KEY`

### Requirement: Skill-based prompting

The runtime SHALL load agent instructions from the same markdown skill files
that drive local harness
execution and pass them as system-prompt content, so that agent behavior is
versioned once and shared between
CI and local flows.

#### Scenario: Skill loaded for a doc-generation call

- **WHEN** a workflow invokes the runtime for a task with an associated skill
  file
- **THEN** the skill file's content is included as system-prompt content for
  that request

### Requirement: Fail loudly on missing requirements

The selected provider workflow and runtime SHALL fail with a clear error naming
every missing, invalid,
unreachable, or incapable requirement of an LLM-dependent CI step. Errors SHALL
identify each item by its
configured org-level secret or variable name where applicable, distinguish
missing configuration from an
unusable provider runtime, and point at complete setup or child-bootstrap
recovery instructions.
LLM-dependent checks MUST NOT silently skip, fall back to another provider, or
report success.

#### Scenario: LiteLLM endpoint variable not configured

- **WHEN** a LiteLLM caller supplies no value from the configured endpoint
  variable name
- **THEN** the workflow fails, names that configured variable, and points at the
  provider setup
  instructions

#### Scenario: Bedrock runtime lacks Converse support

- **WHEN** the Bedrock provider dependency resolves successfully but its client
  lacks the required
  Converse capability
- **THEN** preflight fails before any LLM check, naming the resolved dependency
  version and import path
  plus the corrective installation path

#### Scenario: Endpoint unreachable mid-run

- **WHEN** an LLM request through the selected provider still fails after
  retries
- **THEN** the workflow fails, reporting the selected provider, interrupted
  check, and failure reason

### Requirement: Provider adapters preflight their runtime

Each provider adapter SHALL expose a preflight that runs after provider setup
and before the first
LLM-dependent check. The preflight SHALL verify provider-relevant runtime
capabilities without duplicating
the check in every consumer. Failure SHALL use the same loud operational-failure
contract as missing
configuration.

#### Scenario: Bedrock SDK is too old

- **WHEN** the installed AWS SDK cannot construct a client with the Converse
  operation
- **THEN** one centralized preflight fails before doc-drift or index-currency
  runs

### Requirement: Structured-response retry for non-compliant model output

The runtime SHALL, for any CI check that requires a structured (JSON) response —
the doc-drift,
index-currency, and interface-extraction checks — use a single shared runtime
method that validates
the response against the check's expected shape and, on a parse or validation
failure, retries with
a corrective message appended to the conversation before failing loudly. The
retry budget SHALL be
small and bounded; exhausting it SHALL raise the same loud, exit-code-visible
operational failure
this runtime already guarantees for missing configuration (see "Fail loudly on
missing
requirements") — a check MUST NOT silently accept a response that failed
validation, and MUST NOT
retry indefinitely. This behavior SHALL work against any litellm-compatible
endpoint with no
provider-specific request parameters, consistent with "Provider-agnostic LLM
configuration for CI."

#### Scenario: Non-compliant response is corrected on retry

- **GIVEN** a check requests a structured JSON response and the model's first
  response is prose
  that fails to parse as JSON
- **WHEN** the runtime retries with a corrective message
- **THEN** a second, compliant response is parsed and validated successfully,
  and the check
  proceeds normally with no operational failure

#### Scenario: Persistently non-compliant response fails loudly after the retry budget is exhausted

- **GIVEN** a model's response fails to parse or validate on every attempt
- **WHEN** the runtime exhausts its bounded retry budget
- **THEN** the check fails with an operational-failure error identifying which
  check it was and
  that the response was not the expected shape — the check never silently
  proceeds with malformed
  or partial data

#### Scenario: A validation failure is corrected on retry, not only a syntactic parse failure

- **GIVEN** a model's response is syntactically valid JSON but is missing a
  required field or has
  a field of the wrong type
- **WHEN** the runtime retries with a corrective message describing the specific
  validation problem
- **THEN** the retry can succeed with a shape-correct response, the same
  recovery path as a
  syntactic parse failure

#### Scenario: No provider-specific structured-output parameters are required

- **WHEN** the runtime sends a structured-response request, including any
  corrective retry
- **THEN** the request payload uses the same OpenAI-compatible
  `/chat/completions` shape as any
  other request — no `response_format` or other provider-specific field is
  required for retry and
  validation to work
