# panopticon-ay-eye

## Overview

This is Panopticon — the knowledge base tracking full system architecture, inter-service interfaces, and internal
(same-org) library/package dependencies across our repositories, used to understand how an organization's projects
related to one another and catch breaking changes and incompatibilities before they land.

**Getting started:** see the [org-owner setup guide](docs/setup-guide.md).

To initialize a child repository against either a public or private instance, run the public template
launcher from that child repository:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/industrial-curiosity/panopticon-ay-eye/main/install.py | python3
```

The launcher asks for missing interactive inputs and then runs the installer owned by the selected
instance. Set `PANOPTICON_INSTANCE=YOUR-ORG/YOUR-INSTANCE-REPO` for repeatable runs; for example,
`PANOPTICON_INSTANCE=acme/panopticon-instance`. Private instances use `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or an
existing `gh auth` session. CI runs must provide the instance and required authentication through their
secret environment.

## How it works

There are three repository roles:

- **Template repo** ([panopticon-ay-eye](https://github.com/industrial-curiosity/panopticon-ay-eye), public) — the Python tooling, deterministic interface and dependency parsers,
  shared GitHub Actions workflows, and agent skills. Parsers developed inside organizations are contributed back
  upstream here.
- **Instance repo** (a private copy per organization, aka the "master repo") — the organization's knowledge base:
  `docs/{repo}/` copies of every child repo's documentation, a per-repo interface index shard and a per-repo
  dependency index shard for each child repo, the compiled org-wide interface index and compiled org-wide
  dependency index, a deterministically rebuilt org-wide architecture diagram (`docs/architecture.md`, rendering
  both interface and dependency relationships), and org configuration (check gating, workflow ref policy, diagram
  format, declared internal package registries).
- **Child repos** — the organization's repositories, initialized by a script run from the instance copy. Each child
  repo owns its local docs, local interface index, and local dependency index, and is the authoritative source for
  the interfaces it owns and the packages it publishes.

### Lifecycle

1. **Initialization** — the user's AI agent, guided by the bundled skills, generates the repo's documentation
   (architecture overview — including an agent-drawn `## Architecture diagram` section, per-component, interface,
   and operational docs) and builds its local interface index; tooling run from the instance fork wires the child
   repo to the shared workflows, validates that docs and index meet requirements, and writes
   `panopticon/config.json` — the initialization flag, which also records repo-level settings such as the
   documentation location.
2. **Pull requests** — shared workflows check that the repo is initialized, that documentation was updated when code
   or configuration changes require it (including diagram staleness), that the diagram section exists and is
   well-formed (a separate deterministic check, no LLM call), and run a **pre-merge simulation** of the repo's
   interface changes against the instance repo's compiled index, reporting conflicts as PR comments. The PR's docs
   and index state are pushed to a matching branch named `{repo}/{branch}` in the instance repo, making in-flight
   branch state visible org-wide. Initialization and doc-drift checks fail loudly by default so the developer
   knows what to fix; interface-conflict and diagram-missing checks are advisory by default. Organizations can
   adjust each check type. A separate **tooling-currency check** — always advisory, never gated, no
   `CHECK_TYPES` entry — warns when the repo's wired workflow ref, downloaded skills, or vendored local
   tooling have drifted from the instance repo's current default branch; remediation is `python3 -m
   panopticon.sync` (see below), left to the maintainer's discretion.
3. **Merge to main** — the child repo pushes directly to the instance repo: docs are copied to `docs/{repo}/`, the
   repo's index shard is replaced wholesale, the compiled org-wide index is rebuilt, and the org-wide architecture
   diagram (`docs/architecture.md`, one section per repo with cross-repo interfaces) is deterministically rebuilt
   from that fresh compiled index — no LLM involvement, so it can never disagree with the index. If the merge
   produces conflict entries, issues are opened in both the instance repo and the child repo (at most one open
   conflict issue per repo, updated in place). Conflicts live only in the instance repo — a child repo only knows
   what it knows.
4. **Planning** — when planning a change, a developer's agent reads the instance repo's compiled index (via the
   GitHub CLI or MCP with their personal token) to see which interface connections a change would affect.

**Dependency-indexing's CI wiring status:** local extraction (`python3 -m panopticon.dependency_extraction`),
merge/simulation (`python3 -m panopticon.dependency_merge`), and org-diagram rendering all fully support
dependencies today — the diagram writer reads both the compiled interface and compiled dependency indices and
renders both, regardless of which merge path last ran. The shared reusable workflows (steps 2–3 above) don't yet
call `dependency_extraction`/`dependency_merge` automatically — that's tracked as follow-up work, not silently
dropped. Until then, a repo's dependency index is populated by running the local tooling directly and pushing the
resulting shard.

### The interface index

The index maps meaningful **interface names** (REST endpoints, Kafka topics, gRPC services, S3 buckets, …) to arrays
of interface objects: owner, type, and consumer/producer lists of repos with the source files each repo uses to
create or configure the interface. Names are canonicalized by normalization rules plus LLM judgment at
extraction/merge time, persisted as `panopticon-` hint comments in source files so judgments are stable. The
index describes the **state declared by code, not deployments** — branches are a
first-class dimension; environments (prod/staging) are not. Interfaces are extracted by deterministic parsers where
one exists for the interface type, with LLM-driven extraction as the fallback; extraction without a parser logs a
recommendation to create one.

The owning repo always re-asserts truth on its next merge; manual edits to the instance repo's index are temporary
stopgaps.

### The dependency index

A separate index — own schema, own files (`dependencies/` in the instance repo, `panopticon/dependencies.json`
locally) — tracks **internal (same-org) library/package dependencies**: one repo importing another org repo's
published package. This is a different relationship than a runtime interface (compile-time/library coupling, not
a protocol a repo calls at runtime), so it's never recorded as an interface `type`. Each dependency object has
exactly one self-registered producer (the repo that publishes the package) and any number of consumers, each
recording which specific modules/packages it imports (import-level granularity) — not just that a dependency
exists.

Internality is detected in layers, most portable first: an ecosystem whose dependency declaration already embeds
the org's GitHub identity (Go module paths under `github.com/{org}/...`) resolves with zero configuration; an
org-declared registry host (`internal_registries` in the org config) covers registry-based ecosystems (JVM,
Python, npm, …) with one config field reused for both a consumer detecting a dependency and a producer
self-registering one; a live cross-reference against the instance repo's already-self-registered producers
catches the rest; and a `panopticon-dependency` hint or LLM fallback (with parser-gap reporting, same as
interfaces) handles anything the deterministic layers can't resolve — see `docs/hint-reference.md`. A dependency
that's really just a packaged/generated client for an interface this org already tracks can be linked to it with
a `panopticon-dependency-of` hint (never inferred automatically), which the org diagram uses to render one
combined edge instead of two.

Go ships as the first deterministic parser (`panopticon/parsers/go_mod.py`) — the zero-configuration proof of
concept. Other ecosystems fall back to LLM extraction until a parser is contributed for them.

### Architecture principles

- **Hybrid execution** — deterministic Python for everything structural (checks, index merge/compile, parsers);
  LLM agents only where judgment is required (doc generation, drift detection, extraction fallback).
- **Provider-agnostic agents** — CI agent steps are configured via `PANOPTICON_LLM_API_KEY` and
  `PANOPTICON_LLM_ENDPOINT` secrets; litellm-compatible endpoints are supported first. Local flows
  (initialization, doc updates) run the same skills in the user's preferred AI agent harness and need no LLM
  secrets. Every CI check that requires a structured JSON response (doc-drift, index-currency, interface
  extraction) goes through one shared, hardened runtime method (`LLMClient.complete_json`) that retries with a
  corrective message — never relaxed validation — when a model doesn't comply with a skill's JSON-only response
  contract on the first attempt, before failing loudly. No provider-specific request parameters (e.g.
  `response_format`) are used, so this works across "a wide variety of LLMs" without narrowing which
  litellm-compatible endpoints are supported.
- **Minimal Python requirements** — stdlib-first, checkout-and-run on a bare CI runner, every dependency justified
  and pinned.
- **Cross-repo auth** — an org-level `PANOPTICON_INSTANCE_TOKEN` secret grants read/write access to the private
  instance repo (PR simulation, `{repo}/{branch}` branch pushes, and the merge push). All Panopticon secrets are
  org-level: child repos inherit them and never need per-repo secret or env configuration.

## Repository layout

- `panopticon/` — the stdlib-only Python tooling: interface index schema (`index.py`), dependency index schema
  (`dependencies.py`), interface shard merge / compiled rebuild / simulation (`merge.py`), the dependency
  equivalent (`dependency_merge.py`), name normalization and hints including both interface and dependency hint
  forms (`naming.py`), deterministic interface parsers (`parsers/`, e.g. `kafka_topics.py`/`rest_openapi.py`) and
  the first deterministic dependency parser (`parsers/go_mod.py`), the interface extraction driver
  (`extraction.py`) and its dependency equivalent (`dependency_extraction.py`), registry-host detection and the
  instance cross-reference for dependencies (`dependency_lookup.py`), CI LLM runtime (`llm.py`, `skills.py`), doc
  rendering and diagram-section validation (`docs.py`), doc-drift, index-currency, diagram-existence, and
  tooling-currency checks (`drift.py`, `currency.py`, `diagram_check.py`, `tooling_currency.py` — the last always
  advisory, never gated), deterministic org-wide diagram rendering combining both indices (`diagrams.py`),
  org/repo/diagram config, `internal_registries`, and the protected-config registries (`config.py`), child-repo
  init (`init_repo.py`), the on-demand local sync script (`sync.py`), and the org-diagram link script
  (`org_diagram_link.py`)
- `.github/workflows/` — the reusable workflows child repos call: `panopticon-pr.yml`, `panopticon-merge.yml`,
  `panopticon-pr-close.yml`; plus `sync-from-template.yml`, run from instance repos to pull template updates.
  These don't yet invoke `dependency_extraction`/`dependency_merge` (see "Dependency-indexing's CI wiring status"
  above) — local/manual use of that tooling is fully supported today.
- `interfaces/` — interface index shards + compiled index (empty in the template; populated in instance repos)
- `dependencies/` — dependency index shards + compiled index (empty in the template; populated in instance repos)
- `panopticon.config.json` — org configuration: per-check gating (including `diagram-missing`) and workflow ref
  policy, `protected_paths` — an org-declared list of instance-level customizations (skills, vendored
  tooling modules) excluded from `sync-from-template`'s merge via `.git/info/attributes` (never committed;
  printed to the sync run's step summary instead) — and `internal_registries`, an org-declared list of the org's
  own private package registry hosts, used by dependency-indexing
- `panopticon.diagram.config.json` *(instance repos only)* — diagram rendering format (default `mermaid`);
  protected from `sync-from-template`'s merge via `.gitattributes`
- `PANOPTICON.md` — a concise, static getting-started guide, downloaded verbatim into every child repo's
  root by the bootstrap script (identical across child repos of a given instance; not per-repo templated)
- `tests/` — `unittest` suite ([how to run](docs/testing.md))
- `docs/` — [org-owner setup guide](docs/setup-guide.md), [parser contribution guide](docs/parser-contribution.md),
  [hint annotation reference](docs/hint-reference.md), [testing](docs/testing.md), and project strategy documents
- `openspec/` — spec-driven change management ([OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec))
- `.agents/skills/` — agent skills: project ground rules (`panopticon-architecture`, `panopticon-index-schema`,
  `panopticon-python-tooling`), the bundled Panopticon skills shared by local agents and CI
  (`panopticon-init` orchestrates `panopticon-interface-naming`, `panopticon-interface-extraction`,
  `panopticon-dependency-naming`, `panopticon-dependency-extraction`, and `panopticon-doc-generation`;
  plus `panopticon-doc-drift`, `panopticon-index-currency`), and OpenSpec workflow skills
