# Changelog

All notable changes to Panopticon are documented in this file.

## [add-complex-organization-template] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Added a stdlib-only organization profile validator and reviewable instance
  overlay generator for complex provider onboarding.
- Added concrete direct-OIDC and instance-managed synthetic profiles, generated
  four-gate onboarding checklists, protection metadata, and bounded overlay
  application with preflight checks.

### Changed

- Generated callers and configuration continue to use trusted provider
  contracts, explicit mappings, and provider-derived protection ownership.
- Profiles now reject attempts to classify template-generated or
  provider-derived paths as organization debt.

## [simplify-readme-start-here] - 2026-08-09

### Changed

- README onboarding now gives a concise project orientation and first setup path
  while directing provider, compatibility, and operational details to focused
  guides.
- Repository requirements now enforce a readable, user-focused `Start here`
  section instead of an implementation-heavy block.

## [complete-bedrock-onboarding-hardening] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Bedrock onboarding now supports an optional instance model default and
  validates inference-profile permissions for both the profile and foundation
  model resources.
- Bootstrap and local sync now provide protected credential-action recovery,
  graceful caller-renderer diagnostics, and dependency-safe default payload
  loading.

### Changed

- Provider workflow compatibility now distinguishes caller ABI changes,
  instance-owned defaults, and reusable-workflow fallbacks.
- Tooling and workflow drift checks remain advisory while reporting actionable
  recovery guidance.

### Fixed

- Bedrock-only CLI model defaults are rejected for non-Bedrock providers before
  configuration persistence.

## [harden-rollout-preflight-feedback] - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- Private reusable-workflow preflight guidance now identifies the required
  instance-repository token permissions, valid access response field, and
  recovery for authentication failures.

### Fixed

- Provider workflow configuration failures now emit GitHub error annotations on
  stdout while retaining actionable step summaries.

## [add-org-aware-interface-naming] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Organization-aware interface naming now consults the instance compiled index
  and persists reviewed naming hints before deterministic index generation.
- Provider PR reports now include bounded instance-index candidate analysis and
  the child's Mermaid architecture diagram in the maintained report comment.

### Changed

- Child repositories can override `gating.interface-conflict` as `advisory` or
  `blocking`; both modes publish prominent warnings, while only blocking fails
  the conflict check.
- Deterministic extraction, simulation, and compilation remain independent of
  the LLM and instance index after a naming hint is saved.

## [add-negative-scope-and-ignore-hints] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Deterministic analysis-scope rules exclude illustrative paths and explicit
  file or declaration annotations from interface, dependency, and doc-drift
  analysis.

### Changed

- Generated operations documentation now lists the repository's excluded
  directories, and architecture diagrams link to that scope explanation.

## [harden-bootstrap-manifest-and-workflow-ci] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Credential-free template CI now validates every reusable workflow contract
  and runs the full Python test suite for pull requests, pushes, and manual
  dispatches.

### Changed

- Child bootstrap, sync, and tooling-currency now use a validated versioned
  JSON local-tooling manifest from the authoritative instance source.

### Fixed

- Uncustomized instance bootstrap no longer depends on an executable manifest
  module that the default payload loader does not load.

## [model-effective-provider-requirements] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Trusted optional-provider value resolution with fixed instance-action and
  instance-configuration defaults, plus a source-safe integrator guide.

### Changed

- Child callers and reusable provider workflows now report the effective source
  of each request budget; job timeout is resolved before job creation.
- Bootstrap and finalization now distinguish required organization settings from
  optional values supplied by a trusted default.

## [complete-rollout-status-and-legacy-tooling-guidance] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Advisory detection for instance-excluded and child-only Python tooling in
  child synchronization and tooling-currency checks.

### Changed

- Rollout documentation now records implementation status, current verification
  evidence, and a reviewed migration process for legacy child tooling.

## [restrict-child-sync-tooling-manifest] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Child tooling sync now retrieves the instance-owned manifest on every run
  and updates only its listed modules, excluding CI-only and child-owned files.

## [fix-bedrock-converse-request-shape] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Bedrock Converse requests now omit unsupported optional inference parameters.

## [harden-bedrock-workflow-contract] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Deterministic validation for declared caller inputs and secrets in reusable
  provider PR workflows.

### Fixed

- Bedrock PR evaluation no longer requires LiteLLM endpoint or API-key caller
  configuration.

## [fix-resource-sync-merged-pr] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Child resource sync now opens a new review pull request after its prior
  automation pull request is merged or closed.

## [sync-child-workflow-callers] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Child resource sync now stages the complete managed `panopticon/` directory,
  restores missing managed workflow callers, and preserves child-owned files.

## [surface-org-interface-conflicts] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Organization architecture now inventories every participating repository
  interface and highlights confirmed conflicts and potential same-name/type
  collisions.

## [add-shared-child-resource-sync] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- A manual child resource-sync workflow that refreshes managed skills and
  vendored tooling through a reviewable pull request instead of directly
  changing the default branch.

## [enforce-architecture-link-protocol] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Generated child README and architecture-overview links now consistently use
  the resolver-produced absolute organization-diagram URL; local and
  org-to-child links retain their context-relative paths.

## [prevent-doc-drift-false-positives] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Documentation-only pull requests now pass the doc-drift check without an LLM
  request. Stale-doc findings must cite a changed behavior-bearing file and a
  required update; invalid findings report an operational failure instead.

## [fix-diagram-link-contexts] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Child architecture documentation now uses direct, anchored GitHub links to
  the organization diagram, while links within child documentation remain
  relative and work in both child and instance repositories.

## [add-openai-provider-workflows] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Direct OpenAI configuration and reusable PR-evaluation workflows, with a
  fixed `https://api.openai.com/v1` endpoint and an OpenAI Platform API key.
- Child bootstrap now generates callers for the selected OpenAI provider.

### Changed

- The public launcher, bootstrap, and local sync honor GitHub-provided
  rate-limit waits without shortening them. Installation guidance now recommends
  GitHub authentication for public as well as private instances.

## [default-optional-llm-env-vars] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed (LLM request budgets)

- LiteLLM and Bedrock PR workflows now apply the documented request timeout,
  transport-attempt, and correction-attempt defaults in every LLM check step
  when the corresponding optional organization variable is unavailable.

## [add-github-rate-limit-retries] - 2026-07-25

### Added (initialization)

- `/panopticon-init` now continues from index work through documentation
  generation and finalization in one invocation, deriving required bootstrap
  context without writing the initialization flag early.

### Fixed (GitHub API recovery)

- The public launcher, bootstrap, and local sync now recognize GitHub
  rate-limit responses, wait for `Retry-After` or the reset time when supplied,
  and retry without exposing tokens or response bodies.

## [fix-vendored-provider-and-init-report] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed (initialization)

- Child bootstrap and tooling sync now include the provider registry required by
  local documentation and finalization commands.
- Finalization now leaves a concise, actionable initialization report for both
  successful and blocked runs.

## [fix-bootstrap-provider-loader] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed (bootstrap)

- Restored uncustomized instance bootstrap by loading the provider registry
  before the default bootstrap module runs.

## [fix-template-sync-recovery] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed (template synchronization)

- Corrected protected-path attribute generation so customized generated and
  organization-declared files remain protected during template merges.
- Made template-sync failures identify the failing stage, report the detected
  error, and provide actionable local recovery steps.

## [split-provider-configuration-workflows] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Instance-owned **Configure Panopticon — LiteLLM** and **Configure Panopticon —
  Bedrock** workflows with
  configurable organization secret/variable names; the template no longer
  selects a provider implicitly.
- Separate LiteLLM and native Bedrock Converse/OIDC reusable PR workflows,
  including provider preflight,
  caller configuration revisions, and a pinned CI-only boto3 dependency.
- Shared recovery formatting is vendored after successful child bootstrap, with
  self-contained
  fallbacks for legacy callers and failures that occur before vendoring.

### Changed

- Provider configuration now uses fixed LiteLLM and Bedrock entrypoints that
  show only relevant fields,
  share one validated persistence action, and provide both recovery paths when
  an instance is unconfigured.
- Bedrock setup now offers a clear choice between direct GitHub OIDC (AWS region
  plus IAM role ARN)
  and a fixed instance-managed credentials action; the latter requires neither
  AWS organization variable.
- Child bootstrap validates provider configuration before writing, maps
  organization names explicitly
  without `secrets: inherit`, and prints complete Actions-console, `gh`, and
  exact child-bootstrap recovery.
- The legacy PR workflow now fails loudly with migration instructions so stale
  child callers never run
  against an accidental provider contract.
- Instance template synchronization now delegates to a fixed, template-owned
  reusable workflow, allowing
  synchronization fixes to take effect on the next run without first updating
  each instance caller.
- Template sync now keeps explicit `protected_paths`, the protected diagram
  configuration, and an
  existing generated organization diagram; unprotected template-managed
  customizations can update or
  conflict.
- The README now ends with a video thumbnail whose external YouTube link opens
  in a new browser tab.

### Fixed

- Configuration, provider evaluation, merge synchronization, and PR cleanup
  workflows now put actionable
  failure reasons and recovery instructions in the GitHub Actions step summary.
- Configure Panopticon now imports its checked-out Python tooling successfully
  on clean GitHub-hosted
  runners.

## [add-contribution-guidelines] - 2026-07-24

### Added (contribution guidance)

- Root contribution guidelines with an OpenSpec lifecycle, artifact map, and
  commands for inspecting, validating, and progressing changes.
- README documentation link to the contribution guidelines, focused parser and
  testing references, and Markdown validation guidance using `markdownlint-cli2`.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-07-19

### Changed (section 60)

**Agent runtime** (`agent-runtime`)

- CI LLM request timeout and retry budgets are now optional, bounded
  organization-level variables. Defaults
  allow 90 seconds per request, two transport attempts, and two
  structured-response correction retries;
  invalid values fail before an LLM request is sent.

**PR evaluation** (`pr-evaluation`)

- The reusable PR workflow now has a configurable 20-minute default job timeout
  and passes the request-budget
  variables to its LLM-backed checks. LiteLLM proxy guidance now keeps its
  timeout slightly above Panopticon's
  client timeout so failures remain actionable.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-18

The public installer now dispatches securely to instance-owned installers for
both public and private
repositories, and template sync preserves the instance-generated organization
diagram. Established
across `add-template-installer-wrapper` and `fix-org-diagram-template-sync`.

### Changed (section 86)

**Repo initialization** (`repo-initialization`)

- A single public template launcher now supports public and private instance
  repositories. It resolves
  the instance, ref, and authentication before handing control to the
  instance-owned installer, allowing
  customized installers to retain their own prompts, parameters, and behavior.
- The launcher accepts GitHub Contents API line-wrapped base64 while retaining
  strict base64 and UTF-8
  validation, and keeps prompted or configured tokens out of URLs, command
  arguments, output, errors,
  and persistent storage.

**Architecture diagrams** (`architecture-diagrams`)

- Template sync now classifies `docs/architecture.md` as a fixed,
  template-declared but instance-owned
  generated path. Existing instance diagrams win merges, while the template
  placeholder is installed
  when an instance does not yet have the file.

### Fixed (section 109)

- Routine and first-time template sync no longer conflict on or overwrite an
  instance's generated
  `docs/architecture.md`; the workflow registers `merge=ours` in
  `.git/info/attributes` before merging
  without misclassifying the path as protected JSON configuration or org
  customization.
- The public installer no longer rejects valid GitHub Contents API payloads
  solely because their base64
  content contains transport line wrapping.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-15

`panopticon-init` now wires dependency indexing into the standard initialization
flow, so every
newly initialized repo gets a populated dependency index alongside its interface
index instead of
requiring dependency indexing as a separate, easy-to-forget manual step.
Established across
`openspec/changes/init-dependency-steps`.

### Added (section 131)

**Repo initialization** (`repo-initialization`)

- `panopticon-init`'s orchestration grows from four steps to six:
  `panopticon-dependency-naming`
  and `panopticon-dependency-extraction` now run between interface extraction
  and doc generation,
  so a `panopticon-dependency-of` hint can reference an already-built interface
  index and
  generated docs include dependency edges from the first `/panopticon-init` run.
- The checkpoint log (`panopticon/.init-log.json`) tracks the two new steps,
  preserving resumable
  init across an interrupted agent session.

### Notes

- End-to-end verification of a full `/panopticon-init` run against a real repo
  with genuine
  internal dependencies is deferred to the next real initialization — no fixture
  child+instance
  repo pair with a real cross-repo dependency exists in this workspace, and the
  orchestration is
  agent-followed skill instructions with no Python test harness to simulate it.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-15

Discoverable architecture-diagram links at the top of every instance and child
repo README, and a
non-dead placeholder org diagram for a freshly created instance. Established
across
`openspec/changes/readme-architecture-links`.

### Added (section 164)

**Architecture diagrams** (`architecture-diagrams`)

- Child repo `README.md` now links to both diagrams at the top, own-repo above
  org: a relative link to
  this repo's own `architecture.md`, and a fully-qualified GitHub URL to the org
  diagram — obtained by
  running `python3 -m panopticon.org_diagram_link` and using its printed output
  verbatim, so the two can
  never disagree — written by `panopticon-doc-generation` as part of its normal
  architecture-overview
  pass.
- Instance repo `README.md` now links to the org diagram at the top
  (`docs/architecture.md`) only — no
  per-child-repo links, since the org diagram itself already enumerates every
  repo.
- `write_org_diagram` renders an explicit empty-state placeholder — a link to
  initializing a child repo
  plus a hexagon of six `?` nodes — in place of a bare "no relationships yet"
  line, produced by the same
  deterministic render path every run rather than written once and left stale.
- The template repo ships that placeholder `docs/architecture.md` directly, so a
  freshly created
  instance repo's architecture link is never dead even before any child repo has
  merged; its own
  `README.md` Overview section now carries org-agnostic instance-appropriate
  text plus a maintainer note,
  replacing template self-description that no longer applies once copied into an
  instance repo via "Use
  this template."

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-14

Internal (same-org) library/package dependency tracking, as a relationship
distinct from runtime
interfaces, with its own schema, parsers, merge/conflict detection, and combined
org-diagram
rendering. Established across `openspec/changes/track-internal-dependencies`.

### Added (section 204)

**Dependency indexing** (`dependency-indexing`, new capability)

- Separate JSON index schema (`dependencies/{repo}.json` shards,
  `dependencies/index.json`
  compiled) — own files, never recorded as an interface `type` — with
  `owner`/`producer`/`consumer`
  and, on consumer repo objects, `apis`: a deduplicated, sorted list of the
  specific modules the
  consumer imports (import-level granularity, not call-site).
- Layered internality detection, most portable first: zero-configuration
  structural resolution for
  ecosystems whose declarations embed the org's own GitHub identity (Go module
  paths under
  `github.com/{org}/...`, the first deterministic parser); an org-declared
  `internal_registries`
  config field, reused for both consumer-side detection and producer
  self-registration; a
  no-checkout instance cross-reference (a plain filesystem read in CI, since the
  shared workflows
  already check out the instance repo; a best-effort live GitHub API read
  locally); and a
  `panopticon-dependency` hint / LLM fallback for anything else, with the same
  parser-gap
  reporting contract as interfaces.
- `panopticon-dependency-of <interface-name>` hint: links a dependency that's
  really a
  packaged/generated client for an interface this org already tracks — never
  inferred from naming
  conventions, only set explicitly.
- Shard replace, deterministic compiled-index rebuild, and conflict detection
  (`ownership-dispute`, and the dependency-specific `unregistered-producer`: an
  internal candidate
  with consumers but no self-registered producer anywhere).
- `docs/hint-reference.md`: syntax, placement, and effect for every hint form in
  the tooling
  (`panopticon-interface`, `panopticon-dependency`, `panopticon-dependency-of`).

**Architecture diagrams** (`architecture-diagrams`)

- The org diagram now renders dependency edges alongside interface edges in one
  combined section
  per repo — dashed for interfaces, solid for dependencies — and collapses a
  dependency linked to
  an interface via `panopticon-dependency-of` into a single edge instead of two.

### Notes (section 251)

- CI workflow wiring (the shared `panopticon-pr.yml`/`panopticon-merge.yml`
  invoking the new
  extraction/merge tooling automatically) is not yet included — local/manual use
  of
  `python3 -m panopticon.dependency_extraction` / `dependency_merge` is fully
  supported today,
  matching the existing precedent that full-repo interface extraction is also
  local-only.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-12

Tooling-currency detection for child repos, plus robustness fixes surfaced by
exercising the
0.1.0 release end-to-end. Established across `openspec/changes/tooling-currency`
and
`openspec/changes/robust-llm-verdicts`.

### Added (section 270)

**Tooling currency** (`tooling-currency`, new capability)

- Advisory-only PR check warning when a child repo's wired workflow ref,
  downloaded skills, or
  vendored local tooling have drifted from the instance repo's current default
  branch —
  content-based comparison only, never timestamps, and never gated or folded
  into the combined
  TL;DR report.
- `python3 -m panopticon.sync`: pulls the instance's current skills and tooling
  into an
  already-bootstrapped child repo on demand, overwriting unconditionally (git
  review is the
  safety net); `--check-updates` reports what would change via a git-blob-hash
  comparison without
  writing anything.
- Org-declared `protected_paths` in `panopticon.config.json`: arbitrary
  instance-level
  customizations (skills, tooling modules) excluded from `sync-from-template`'s
  merge via
  `.git/info/attributes` (never a commit, never the tracked `.gitattributes`),
  printed to the sync
  run's step summary since the protection itself is invisible in the tracked
  tree.

**Repo initialization** (`repo-initialization`)

- `PANOPTICON.md`: a concise, static getting-started guide downloaded to every
  child repo's root
  on bootstrap, covering the three repo roles, where architecture diagrams live,
  and how to run
  the sync script; the bootstrap script's printed output now names both on every
  run.
- `panopticon/config.json` gains `instance_default_branch`, resolved via the
  same GitHub
  token/transport mechanism the bootstrap script already uses for every other
  request (never a
  `gh api` subprocess call, which depends on `gh auth login` specifically) —
  refreshed in place on
  every bootstrap rerun of an already-initialized repo.
- Bootstrap now writes `panopticon/.gitignore` (`__pycache__/`) alongside the
  vendored local-tooling
  modules, so running them (as the bundled skills instruct) never leaves
  compiled bytecode staged
  on the next `git add -A`.

**Architecture diagrams** (`architecture-diagrams`)

- `python3 -m panopticon.org_diagram_link`: prints an immediately clickable link
  to a child repo's
  section of the org-wide diagram, for use before that repo's docs have been
  merged into the
  instance (the embedded in-doc link only resolves after merge). Reads local
  config first with no
  network call; falls back to a live lookup only when needed.

**Agent runtime** (`agent-runtime`)

- Structured LLM responses (doc-drift, index-currency, interface-extraction
  verdicts) now recover
  from a non-compliant first response via one shared, bounded corrective-retry
  method instead of
  failing outright — the model's non-compliant answer plus a specific correction
  are appended to
  the conversation and retried before failing loudly. No provider-specific
  request parameters, so
  this works across any litellm-compatible endpoint.

### Fixed (section 340)

- Child repo's `## Architecture diagram` section linked back to the org diagram
  with a malformed,
  non-resolving URL (missing GitHub's required `/blob/<branch>/` path segment);
  corrected to a
  relative link that resolves once merged into the instance repo.
- A model responding with prose reasoning instead of a JSON verdict crashed the
  doc-drift check
  outright with no recovery path — now corrected via retry (see agent-runtime,
  above).
- `instance_default_branch` resolution depended on `gh auth login` having been
  run interactively,
  a stricter precondition than the token-based auth the bootstrap script's own
  downloads already
  relied on successfully — a working `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` now resolves it
  directly.
- The org diagram's links to each child repo's own diagram used the href
  `docs/{repo}/architecture.md`,
  but the org diagram file itself already lives inside `docs/`, so GitHub
  resolved that relative link
  to the non-existent `docs/docs/{repo}/architecture.md` — every such link
  404'd. Corrected to the
  literal relative href `{repo}/architecture.md`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-10

First usable release: an org-wide interface catalog and documentation system,
initialized from a
GitHub template, with LLM-assisted extraction/naming, deterministic conflict
detection, and CI
gating for pull requests. Established across
`openspec/changes/establish-panopticon-core`.

### Added (section 374)

**Interface indexing** (`interface-indexing`)

- JSON index schema (`schema_version`, name-keyed interface objects with
  `owner`, `type`,
  `consumer`/`producer` repo lists), describing code state — not deployment
  state — on a branch.
- Deterministic parser registry (`detect`/`extract` contract), with starter
  parsers for
  REST/OpenAPI and Kafka topic configs.
- LLM extraction fallback for interface types with no deterministic parser,
  tagged
  `extracted_by: "llm"`, with parser-gap recommendations surfaced in the CI
  summary.
- Name normalization and matching: deterministic rules plus local LLM judgment,
  persisted as
  `panopticon-interface` hint comments; CI resolves names from hints and rules
  alone, with no LLM
  judgment calls during compile.
- Shard replace + deterministic compiled-index rebuild, and conflict detection
  (`ownership-dispute`, `owner-attribution-mismatch`) recomputed on every
  rebuild.

**Agent runtime** (`agent-runtime`)

- Provider-agnostic, stdlib-only LLM client for CI (litellm-compatible
  `/chat/completions`), with
  retries and fail-loud behavior on missing configuration or unreachable
  endpoints.
- Skill-based prompting: the same markdown skill files drive both CI and local
  agent-harness
  execution, so behavior is versioned once and shared between the two.

**Documentation generation** (`doc-generation`)

- Four generated documentation layers per repo (architecture overview,
  per-component docs,
  interface docs, operational docs), regenerated in place with no stale sections
  left behind.
- Interface docs are deterministically rendered from the local index — never
  hand-edited or
  LLM-authored — so they can never disagree with it.
- LLM-based doc-drift check for CI, with self-contained, actionable remediation
  instructions
  (exact command/skill per stale doc) in the GitHub Actions summary and PR
  comment; now also
  judges the architecture overview's `## Architecture diagram` section for
  staleness the same way
  as its prose.
- Initialization-time drift resolution: local agent runs revise documentation
  that contradicts the
  current repo state, recording what was resolved in `panopticon-changelog.md`
  rather than
  cluttering the docs themselves; genuinely ambiguous cases prompt the user
  instead of guessing.

**Architecture diagrams** (`architecture-diagrams`)

- Agent-drawn `## Architecture diagram` section in every repo's architecture
  overview — a
  component/data-flow diagram in the org's configured format (default Mermaid),
  grounded in the
  actual code, with a back-link to the org diagram.
- Deterministic, LLM-free org-wide diagram (`docs/architecture.md` in the
  instance repo): one
  section per repo with cross-repo interfaces, a relationship diagram, and an
  interface table,
  rebuilt on every merge to main directly from the compiled index so it can
  never disagree with
  it. Interfaces used only within a single repo are excluded from the org
  diagram.
- Diagram rendering format is configurable per instance
  (`panopticon.diagram.config.json`,
  default `mermaid`); an unsupported configured format fails loudly rather than
  silently skipping
  diagram generation.
- Navigation between the org diagram and per-repo diagrams uses plain markdown
  links, not
  diagram-native `click` directives, since GitHub does not reliably support
  Mermaid click-to-URL
  navigation.

**Repo initialization** (`repo-initialization`)

- Stdlib-only bootstrap installer (`install.py`), runnable via `curl | python3`
  with no local
  instance clone, including piped-execution self-bootstrapping and a GitHub API
  retry/backoff
  contract for transient failures.
- Interactive skills-location selection (arrow-key menu with typed fallback,
  environment-variable
  override, idempotent re-run reuse) across every supported agent-harness tool.
- `panopticon-init` orchestrating skill sequencing interface naming, extraction,
  doc generation,
  and finalization in dependency order, with a resumable checkpoint log.
- Three-phase initialization (deterministic bootstrap → AI-driven agent pass →
  deterministic
  finalization), writing `panopticon/config.json` only after validation passes.
- Default-branch workflow-ref resolution requiring no manual tagging step on a
  fresh instance,
  with org-configurable pinning.
- General protected-instance-local-config mechanism: `sync-from-template.yml`
  excludes registered
  paths (starting with `panopticon.diagram.config.json`) from its merge via a
  `.gitattributes`
  `merge=ours` driver, so an instance's customization always wins over what the
  template ships,
  and warns (non-blocking) when the template adds or removes a field the
  instance hasn't picked up.

**PR evaluation** (`pr-evaluation`)

- Reusable PR workflow: initialization check, doc-drift check, index-currency
  check, a
  deterministic diagram-existence check (architecture diagram section present
  and well-formed, no
  LLM call), pre-merge index simulation (dry-run over the same merge code path
  as the real merge),
  and `{repo}/{branch}` branch-state push to the instance repo.
- Org-configurable gating per check type (init/doc-drift blocking,
  interface-conflict and
  diagram-missing advisory, by default), read from the instance repo's
  `panopticon.config.json`
  rather than hardcoded.
- Combined report: a de-duplicated TL;DR leading (and trailing) the GitHub
  Actions summary and PR
  comment, collapsing every doc-drift/index-currency/diagram-existence finding
  into a single "run
  panopticon-doc-generation once" action regardless of how many docs, the index,
  or the diagram
  section are affected.
- CI checks distinguish an operational failure (crash, malformed LLM response,
  unreachable
  endpoint) from a genuine business verdict by a fixed exit-code contract, so a
  check that could
  not run is never silently misreported as passing or as a stale-docs finding —
  and every
  independent check still runs and reports its own outcome regardless of an
  earlier failure.

**Master sync** (`master-sync`)

- Merge-to-main sync workflow: docs copied to `docs/{repo}/`, index shard
  replaced wholesale,
  compiled index rebuilt, pushed directly to the instance repo's default branch
  (no PR).
- Deterministic org-wide architecture diagram rebuilt in the same commit as the
  compiled index,
  with no dependency on any child repo having a diagram section yet.
- Fetch-rebase-retry loop for concurrent pushes from multiple child repos,
  touching only the
  compiled-index rebuild on retry — shards are never cross-modified.
- Conflict-issue creation in both the instance and child repo on a merge
  conflict, cross-linked,
  updating the existing issue rather than opening duplicates across repeated
  merges.
- Instance branch lifecycle: the matching `{repo}/{branch}` branch is deleted
  when a PR closes.

### Fixed (section 534)

- Module-shadowing bug where the child repo's vendored `panopticon/` subset
  silently shadowed the
  instance repo's full package during CI checks (`python -m`/`-c` prepend cwd to
  `sys.path` ahead
  of `PYTHONPATH`), fixed via `PYTHONSAFEPATH=1` at job level.
- Exit-code collision where an uncaught check exception and a genuine "stale"
  verdict produced the
  same exit code, causing crashes to be silently misreported as business
  verdicts.
